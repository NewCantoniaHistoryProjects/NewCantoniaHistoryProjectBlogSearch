Wu Tingfang was recruited by Li Hung-chang to play an active role in China’s legal and diplomatic reforms. Ho Kai, in turn, was recruited by Wu for reforms in China. While Wu worked for China’s reforms for over two decades, Ho stayed in China for only a brief period of time.<br>Li Hung-chang’s political career as well as the patronage network built under him, suddenly changed direction in 1895. The Western Affairs Movement suffered a fatal blow in 1895 when China was defeated in the Sino-Japanese War, and Li Hung-chang was held responsible for China’s defeat; his high position in the national politics of China was seriously reduced; he lost his prestigious high posts in northern China, and was ‘demoted’ to Governor-General of Guangdong-Guangxi.<br>After 1895, saving China by reform and revolution was much discussed in South China, as well as Hong Kong. Two Cantonese emerged as prominent figures: Liang Qichao, a famous reformer, and Sun Yat-sen, a famous revolutionary (and a student of Ho Kai in the Hong Kong College of Medicine in Hong Kong). In the colony, these opinions could be found among the Chinese leaders. The most active of these opinionmakers was the English-educated group, Ho Kai and his associates. Ho’s writing depicted Hong Kong as an ideal society where the Western system had been successfully transplanted to Chinese soil. He addressed China’s weakness in the light of its own backwardness and believed that the foreign presence was beneficial to China. He believed also, that to cure China’s weakness the Western system must be understood and adopted.<br>In 1900, there was an abortive attempt, initiated by two Chinese Legislative Councillors in Hong Kong (Ho Kai and the newly appointed Wei Yuk), to make South China politically independent from the Peking government. This incident also involved Sun Yat-sen, Li Hung-chang, and the Governor of Hong Kong. This attempt was first disclosed in the memoirs of a Cantonese revolutionary known to be very close to Sun Yatsen. Harold Schiffrin and Chan Lau Kit-ching have made use of British public records to examine the general reliability of this information.<br>In 1900, the Boxer Uprising sparked off joint foreign military action in Peking. The Qing government declared war against the foreigners. The issue divided Chinese officialdom into two factions. In the North, viceroys of many provinces followed Peking’s instructions. In the South, strikingly, viceroys of many provinces (led by Li Hung-chang) declared themselves neutral so as to save the provinces they ruled from foreign invasion.<br>A close follower of Sun Yat-sen recorded later in his memoirs that Ho Kai, Legislative Councillor of Hong Kong, drafted a proposal, signed by Sun Yat-sen, and sent it to the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Henry Blake. It started with the following sentences:<br> We, patriots in the South, submit this letter to Your Excellency Blake, … Now, that the North is in trouble and the whole situation [of China] is being shaken … the provinces will certainly be devastated … We witness in it the difficulties of these times, we seek a remedy.<br>Schiffrin documents that in early July, Governor Blake sent a despatch to the Colonial Office stating that he had been told by ‘a Chinese gentleman who has exceptional facilities for obtaining information that there would be an uprising in a fortnight’s time’. ‘The uprising was not an anti-foreign movement’, the Governor was told, and ‘the men engaged in it hope that when they had met with some success they might obtain British protection.’<br>Blake also recorded<br> there are rumours that he [Li Hung-chang] wishes to establish himself either as King or as president. He sent over here about ten days ago hisbrother … to meet Sun Yat-sen … I think that having regard to the present state of the North, such a movement is very probable and that we ought to be prepared and to look after our interests.<br>The ‘Chinese gentleman’ to whom the Governor referred was most probably Ho Kai, the Chinese Legislative Councillor. By submitting this proposal, Ho Kai sought the Governor’s assistance in persuading Li Hungchang to declare Guangdong independent. Governor Blake, anticipating that China was about to be partitioned, was anxious to find ways to protect Chinese Business Groups and Political Change British interests in Southern China. The Governor, convinced by Ho, requested the British Consul-General in Canton to contact Li Hung-chang and inform him of his scheme. Li was reported to have reacted favourably. He had also ‘entered into communication’ with Sun Yat-sen. In a despatch to the Colonial Office, Blake reported that British officials in Singapore had confirmed with him that Sun Yat-sen was travelling from Singapore to Canton. He was preparing for a meeting with Li Hung-chang. The Governor also said that Li had charted out the following:<br> If the Emperor is dead he [Li Hung-chang] would be prepared to declare the two Kwangs [Guangdong and Guangxi] a separate government.<br>At this critical juncture, an imperial edict issued by the Qing court reached Li Hung-chang. The turbulent blow to the dynasty turned out to be the saving grace in the (supposedly) sinking political career of Li Hung-chang. He was offered a prestigious post in the North, and was recalled urgently to Peking where political disorder was disrupting the court. Li was entrusted with the task of tidying up the chaos after the Boxer Uprising.<br>In the South, the fear that Li was about to leave for the North provoked great fear among the Chinese in Hong Kong and Guangdong. The Governor of Hong Kong, through the Consul-General in Canton, also urged Li to reconsider his decision. Tactfully refusing this advice, Li put forward a request for an interview with the Governor in his passage through Hong Kong to Peking. Speculation arose over one issue: whether Li would really depart from Canton. All the major British newspapers in Hong Kong also urged the colonial Governor to exert pressure on Li to remain in Canton. Even the Manager of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank sent a telegram to Blake urging him ‘to use influence to keep Viceroy [Li] at Canton’. Governor Blake reported to London:<br> The American admiral has been asked by Li Hung-chang to take him north … I have informed the American admiral of the desire of H.M. Government that Li Hung-chang should remain in Canton for the present … The American admiral has delayed taking any action. Li’s presence in the South is very necessary.<br>At this point, Governor Blake sent an urgent telegram to the Colonial Office asking for permission to detain Li by force while he was in Hong Kong. On the day before Li Hung-chang’s arrival, a Chinese Legislative Councillor, obviously desperate, asked to see Governor Blake. Governor Blake immediately reported to the Colonial Office that the Chinese Councillor disclosed to him that while Li did not dare to ignore the imperial edict, he would like to have an excuse for refusing. A second telegram was sent to London. Governor Blake, again, asked for permission to detain Li by military force. The Governor wrote:<br> Wei Yuk, one of the Chinese members of the Legislative Council, called upon me on behalf of the Chinese here whose families are in Canton, begging me to use my influence to prevent Li from leaving his province and saying that a well known Chinese official closely connected with the Yamen had come down and informed him that while the Viceroy did not feel safe in refusing to obey the Edict, he would be glad to have such pressure applied as would enable him hereafter to explain his inability to act upon it.<br>The reply from London reached Governor Blake on the same day: London forbade him to take any action against Li Hung-chang. The Hong Kong government was instructed by London to remain neutral. The next day, the Governor met Li. He recorded something very interesting and reported it to London:<br>The Viceroy asked … whom the Powers wanted to see to be Emperor. Who would England like to see Emperor? … I answered that in such an event the Powers would probably ask the advice of the strongest man in China that they could find as to what was best to be done.<br>At the conclusion his record, the Governor predicted that Li ‘would remain in Shanghai until the tide turns’. His prediction proved correct. After passing through Hong Kong, Li travelled northward, and stayed in Shanghai for three months before departing for Peking. Li led a greatly respected life in the North before he passed away in 1901. Yuan Shikai, a recruit of Li’s, replaced Li and established himself as one of the most influential men in the Qing court.<br>For the Hong Kong Chinese, the plan for an independent South China eventually fell through but all kinds of possibilities were still ahead. Even though the endeavour in 1900 had no immediate effect, we learn from the incident that, as early as in 1900, the Chinese leaders in Hong Kong had shown interest in supporting an independent Guangdong. The attitude of the British Colonial Office and Foreign Office (toward the possibility of an independent Guangdong), divergent from that of the Governor of Hong Kong, proved to be crucial to the political development of South China from 1900 onward.</p></div></div></section>
