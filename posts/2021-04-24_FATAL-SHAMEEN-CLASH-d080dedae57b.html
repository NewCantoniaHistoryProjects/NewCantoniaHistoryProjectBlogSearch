They opened fire opposite the Victoria Hotel in the British Concession.</p><p name="20cb" id="20cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">British and French Marines replied with machine guns. The firing lasted twenty minutes.</p><p name="8ad1" id="8ad1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A French merchant named- Pasquier, and the Commissioner of Customs were, killed.</p><p name="dee8" id="dee8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One British Marine and two civilians were wounded.</p><p name="5cae" id="5cae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All the evidence indicates that the Chinese fired first.-Reuter.</p><p name="ef4b" id="ef4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">EYEWITNESS’S STORY:</strong></p><p name="b451" id="b451" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The report that the Chinese fired first is confirmed to a certain extent by the statement made to a “China Mail” representative this morning bythe compradore of W.A.Hannibal &amp; Co., who was one of the passengers on the Sai On which was alongside at the Canton side when the firing took place.</p><p name="cf71" id="cf71" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I saw many schoolboys- and workmen marching along the Bund about half past two yesterday afternoon,” he said. “And when they had got about half way past Shameen they fired shots across to the Shameen side, The fire was returned. Rain came down heavily about the same time and I saw the people running but very little else. The Sai On remained alongside for many hours and I saw foreigners leaving Shameen for the gunboats.”</p><p name="3fd4" id="3fd4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The “China Mail” informant said that his information had been first that twenty Chinese had been killed as a result of the fire from Shameen and then, that fifty had been killed. It was impossible to ascertain anything definite in this respect as the Sai On had its own difficulties to contend with, the seamen having left to attend a meeting on shore at which they were to be told whether or not they would be allowed to man the ship to bring it back to Hongkong. The crew returned and said that they were to be allowed to make the trip. The ship left about 7 p.m. and arrived in Hongkong early this morning.</p><p name="ebb4" id="ebb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A man in a sampan who was making for the Sai On from Shameen was killed when within a few feet of the boat, according to our informant, who added that as the boat passed Honam about 8 p.m. he observed soldiers of General Li Fook-lam’s army leaving Honam for Canton.</p><p name="e7ef" id="e7ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">PANIC OF CROWDS</strong></p><p name="dbe6" id="dbe6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So far the rumour that a detachment of the East Surreys is to leave Hongkong for Canton today is not confirmed offcially, but it is significent that the s.s. Paul Beau which arrivied in Hongkong early this morning, from Canton, is now lying off Stonecutter’s Island, and that the Sai On, also from Canton, is under orders to leave for the same port. At present the Sai On is alongside the wharf and refugees are still swarming the vicinity.</p><p name="e0a7" id="e0a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The crowds which have come down from Canton are said to be as large as those going to that city. The crowds on the wharf at present seem puzzled what to do. They drift on and off the ships according to whether or not it is raining at the time. They all appear to ??? through and ??? consolate. A guard of Volunteers is on duty at the wharves. A West River steamer appears to be the only boat that will leave today for the “China Mail” understands that no ships will leave for Canton for the present. The vessels tied up here, it is stated, will be used to house European refugees from Shameen arriving by the s.s Honam in large numbers this afternoon. The Honam is reported to have been manned by naval ratings. The refugees are said to number 600 — though one report puts the figure at 1,500. The wounded are aboard, it is added and the ambulance will moot the vessel here.</p><p name="c488" id="c488" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">摘自The China Mail, 1925–06–24</p></div></div></section>
