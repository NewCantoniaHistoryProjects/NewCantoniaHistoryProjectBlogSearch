This gentleman has been mentioned as having pointed out that it is not now a question of smouldering embers which might be fanned into flames, but rather of roaring furnances of discontent. There are, he points out, five or six different factions each nursing its own pet grievances, and the time when a body of influential men could have come forward and settled matters amicably is past. The differences have grown to such an extent that angry feelings will soon find vent some way or other.</p><p name="ccf3" id="ccf3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Open strife between the merchants and the labourers, an attempt by the former to boycott the civil government economically and to cut off its food supplies, the shifting disposition of non-native mercenaries, rumours of armies having pro-Northern tendencies, jealousy among the troops, an unconfirmed report of the capture by a Chan Kwing-ming man of the Tiger Island Forts guarding the entrance to Canton harbour, digging of trenches along the Canton-Kowloon Railway from Shektan to Shekpai, alleged threats to bombard the western suburb, the presence of armoured cars in Canton streets, a general strike in progress, the Merchant Volunteers and Village Guards in arms and martial law in the city — these are the most important features of the chaos which threatens to overwhelm Canton.</p><p name="8a48" id="8a48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yesterday’s down steamers were all full of people from Canton, one saloon being packed with families of Yunnanese military officers. News was also brought down by last night’s steamers that Wu Han-min, acting for Dr.Sun, had given orders that the Volunteers were to be disarmed and it was alleged that preparations would be made for Saikwan to be stormed. As telegraph communication is interrupted, it is not known if the order was carried out or what the Merchants are doing.</p><p name="7ee6" id="7ee6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Conditions in Canton.</strong></p><p name="04de" id="04de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apropos yesterday’s developments in Canton, our special correspondent writes:</p><p name="7e65" id="7e65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Orders are stated to have been given to the Yunnanese, Hunanese and Kwangsi armies to disarm the Merchants Volunteer Corps at 6 p.m. this evening.</p><p name="55f3" id="55f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yunnanese detachments under General Fan Shek-sang and Commander Liu Hang-Chiu (who successfully negotiated for the settlement of the first general strike) are being strengthened outside Saikwan, the Western part of Canton city. Their attbude is unknown but it is believed that they are pro-peace but, if necessary, will side with the civil population.</p><p name="9ff0" id="9ff0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wu Te-chen, who recently resigned his position as Police Commissioner, has returned as commander of the “Red” army. He has armoured cars in Canton and the report goes that he is mounting big guns on the White Cloud Mountains. His Reds and the Labourers Volunteers have been mobilised in the struggle against the merchants.</p><p name="89ea" id="89ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A very strict watch is being kept on Shakee which faces Shameen. No troops other than Yunnanese or Merchants Volunteers are allowed through.</p><p name="915b" id="915b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Day and night the merchants are sending out patrols in all parts of Saikwan, as far is the Taiping Maloo and the second band. Village Guards are also moving towards Canton ostensibly to reinforce the Volunteers.</p><p name="e0d5" id="e0d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dr. Sun Yat-sen is believed by many to have come back to Canton to hold a conference but he has probably left again.</p><p name="d65f" id="d65f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">摘自The China Mail, 1924–10–15</p></div></div></section>
