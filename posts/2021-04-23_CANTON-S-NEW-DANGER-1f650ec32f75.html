Civil strife, followed by outlawry, has removed one faction — the Merchants Volunteer Corps — and it was thought the city would gradually settle down amidst the ruins of incendiarism to the restless, uncertain life that has now been its lot for bo long.</p><p name="2763" id="2763" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yesterday afternoon, however, there was a persistent rumour that the Yunnaneee mercenaries were likely to fall out with the Cantonese pro-Government contingents under General Hsu Shung-chi and General Li Fook-lam. respectively, and Wu Te-chen’s Red Army.</p><p name="d495" id="d495" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Sun Yat-Sen — — Canton’s Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde.</strong></p><figure name="a85d" id="a85d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*aXQKv0yYoPMR1767ykMN_g.png" data-width="594" data-height="982" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aXQKv0yYoPMR1767ykMN_g.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong">The Man of Peace</strong></figcaption></figure><figure name="cb4e" id="cb4e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*3L6uk9tfRfDfAf51Lo3bmQ.png" data-width="590" data-height="975" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3L6uk9tfRfDfAf51Lo3bmQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><strong class="markup--strong markup--figure-strong">The Man of Blood</strong></figcaption></figure><p name="ae03" id="ae03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">A dispute as to who should have the privilege — — or should it not be the pleasure ? — — of disarming the Volunteers (and taking over their arms and equipment) together with carrying out the house-to-house search, is believed to have arisen. With the valuable prize in sight, it is not to be wondered at that there is competition for the honour of wanting to round-up the Volunteers.</p><p name="c132" id="c132" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Passengers arriving by last night’s down steamers oould not confirm the reports but several well-informed people felt that further fighting over the spoils, was probable. The civil population was still in suspense. Business was at a standstill as everybody was busy getting away to Hongkong or Macao, or at least, across the river to Honam which has been immune from outrages. However, on inquiry from the Naval authorities this morning, it was gathered that no further fighting had broken out and that the city was still quiet.</p><p name="d2e2" id="d2e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Writing yesterday afternoon, our special correspondent mentioned the efforts of one or two Canton citizens to prevent further bloodshed by reconciling the differences of the forces that have covetous eyes on the Western Suburb.</p><p name="0ae5" id="0ae5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Searches were still being executed in houses and shops, the soldiersseizing what arms they would find; but on the whole, the troops, after the first victory, had become more orderly.</p><p name="2865" id="2865" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">General Fan Shek-sang and Lieut-General Lin Hang-chiu of the Yunnauese army are reinforcing their detachments on Shakee(facing Shameen) and strengthening their cordons in the Western Suburb. Meanwhile, the Cantonese troops and the Red Army are not idle, They are carrying out the search for Volunteers in other parts of the city.</p><p name="7aba" id="7aba" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“CONGRATULATIONS!”<br>BOLSHEVIK BRITONS’ GREETING.<br>“MAGNIFICENT VICTORY.”</strong><br>(Reuter’s Service.)<br>London, October 18.</p><p name="67d7" id="67d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The British Communist Party has telegraphed congratulating heartily Dr. Sun Yat-sen “on his magnificent victory over the Fascist Army raised by Chinese Capitalists.”</p><p name="2ffb" id="2ffb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">摘自The China Mail, 1924–10–20</p></div></div></section>
