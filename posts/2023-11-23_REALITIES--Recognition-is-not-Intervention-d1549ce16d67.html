BRONSON REA</p><p name="e96a" id="e96a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Two hundred million unemployed: Nearly half the population of China without means of earning a living! This estimate, based on conditions existing in 120 districts, was recently made public by the Ministry of Interior.<br>Three million people dead from unnatural causes with six millions facing starvation, is the report which comes from Kansu, Kokonor and Ninghsia. Cannabalism is not uncommon in these regions.<br>Ten million people have fled from the province of Kiangsi, more than 100,000 homes have been destroyed, 180,000 people killed and property to the value of $700,000,000 destroyed in this province. Generalissimo Chiang reports the communists have been wiped out!<br>Five million people were starved to death last year in Shensi and Shansi, the direct result of quartering the armies of Feng Yu-hsiang in these districts. A hundred thousand or more young women were sold to the dive-keepers of other provinces, and taxed as they passed through the likin station.<br>Now comes the crowning disaster. The Yangtsze River has risen to unprecedented heights, inundating about 50,000 square miles of territory in the provinces of Hupeh, Hunan, Kiangsi, Anhwei and Kiangsu. Over four million homes have been swept away. Thirty million people are homeless ; ten million are facing famine ; six million acres of farming land are flooded ; the WuHan cities are under water ; a total initial damage of $200,000,000is reported. The real horror is yet to come. Other rivers in China are breaking through the dykes, spreading disaster, hunger and death to further millions of helpless people.<br>The picture of Manchuria is outlined in another article in this issue of The Far Eastern Review. The three most prosperous provinces of China have been systematically looted over 4 period of years to support the armies which hold the “stupidpeople” in bondage to their overlords. Over six billion dollars in worthless paper notes have been forced on the farmers in exchange for their export crops. Nearly a billion gold yen has been raised in this manner during the past six years to pay for the armies of theManchurian military oligarchy. Another year of decline in demand and low prices for the soya bean, will open the way for Soviet domination in North Manchuria. The stage is set there for another calamity.<br>Half the people in China are without work. Millions are homeless, destitute, starving. The cry of agony, the appeals for succor from the unfortunates fall on deaf ears. The common laws of humanity cannot operate in China. Outside charity cannot be distributed with any guarantee that the funds or supplies will reach the suffering people. The calamity in China comes at a time when the unemployed millions of other countries are standing in the bread lines, living on the charity of their own peoples and governments.<br>There is no money in China for famine or flood relief. Every dollar that can be squeezed from the people in taxes or through confiscation of property and wealth goes to maintain the vampire armies sucking the last drop of the people’s blood. The money that might be employed for the relief of humanity cannot be diverted from the purchase of arms and munitions. The maintenance of law and order, the first duty of organized government is subordinated to the perpetuation of military rule. Over five million armed men are living upon the impoverished people. Three million men are incorporated in the 288 divisions that make up the various provincial armies. Nearly one million comprise the army of Chiang Kai-shek, the backbone of the National Government.The Manchurian armies number at least 500,000: Szechuen has over 300,000; Kwangsi and Kwangtung another 200,000. God alone knows just how many men are carrying a rifle in China.The bandits, communists and independent armies number more than two million. How are they paid? They are not paid. They eat however, and must be clothed, armed and munitioned. The armies are equipped with the most modern death dealing instruments ; artillery, machine-guns, aeroplanes, tanks, trucks and automobiles, all purchased from abroad.We know how the money has been raised to maintain the Manchurian armies, prosecute wars of conquest and build the largest arsenal in the world. In the published budget figures of Minister Soong, we get a glimpse of the sources from which are derived the means to keep Nanking in power. According to the budget of 1930 the National armies cost $245,000,000 with a deficit of $100,000,000 made up by borrowing. This year the deficit will reach nearly $280,000,000. <br>We know how Nanking has been able to raise the funds to pay for its armies and its wars of pacification and unification. Most of it has come from foreign trade ;the result of tariff autonomy conceded by the foreign powers in order to assist Nanking to establish its rule. We know that the Szechuen army is maintained largely by the revenues from the opium traffic. The same with the armies of Kwangsi and Yunnan.<br>The 1931 Nanking budget reveals that military expenses account for 87.5 percent of the government’s total revenues. The new wars that must be waged to compel the Canton group to recognize the dictatorship of Chiang and the further campaigns necessary to establish his rule over other recalcitrant provinces will call for additional sources of revenues to feed the military moloch. Millions for conquest, but not one cent for relief! Faced with the catastrophic floods on the Yangtsze, and the urgent need for relief, the treasury of Nanking is empty. To meet this national disaster, Nanking’s sole remedy is to float an internal loan of$20,000,000, a mere gesture that cannot hope to cope with the emergency. But the imports of foreign arms and munitions continue. Nanking is continually purchasing new equipment. The “independent ’’ provinces find no difficulty in having all their arms requirements supplied from abroad. Arms, arms and more arms! Artillery, machine-guns, automatics, rifles, aeroplanes and all the paraphernalia for modern civilized slaughter are pouring intoChina. These must be paid for. Money, money; loans, loans and more loans; taxes and more taxes are needed to meet the bills.<br>No nation, no matter how strong or prosperous can stand the exactions of such a system. The hungry people, driven to desperation swell the ranks of the roving bandits and communist organization ; then they must be killed off in order that government by the bayonet may endure. The people of China have no vote, no voice In the conduct of their own affairs. They have become the abject slaves of their military taskmasters and when in despair, they revolt against their enforced bondage, the military machine is set in motion to exterminate them. <br>The people of China through their glib-tongued self-appointed foreign educated spokesmen, have demanded from the rest of the world the right to solve their problems in their own way withoutOutside interference. That right has been conceded. The result before us. In the face of the appalling conditions throughout the country, Humanity at large has the right to demand by what authority these champions speak in the name of the inarticulate millions whose rights as human beings are being sacrificed to a mistaken pride of race and a stubborn refusal on the part of their more vocal political leaders to admit their inability to establish a government capable of discharging its most rudimentary obligation. Under the slogan of unification, which in Chinese means the right of one overlord or faction to impose its will upon the rest of the country, millions upon millions of human beings have been done to death, and the country is further off from unification than ever.<br>For, let us make no mistake about the aims and aspirations of the several factions now ruling the country. The ambition of every warlord, every political henchman and their hangers-onis to conquer and rule the rest of the ethnological group, called for the want of a better name, the Chinese nation. There is no Chinesenation. There is a Mongolian race to which the various peoplesand clans that inhabit what is known as China, belong. There is as much difference between the Manchurian and the Cantonese,in language, customs, manner of thought and living as there is between the Norwegian and the Greek. China is a continent inhabited by a race split into as many diverse nationalities asEurope. The only bond is one of race, the same bond that unites the people of Europe into one common division of mankind. Until the Chinese themselves recognize this basic truth and are willing to settle their differences by a mutual recognition of each others independence there can be no permanent peace in Cathay. The picture of China is the reflection of medieval Europe. As at various periods in history one European nation has attempted to subjugate all the others, so in China each province has at some time or other set out to conquer the others and impose its rule. No province of China will ever relinquish its claims to rule over an undivided country and in the process of establishing its authority by force of arms, no more consideration is given to the rights of the peoplethan Alexander, Caesar or Napoleon extended to the vanquished states of Europe.<br>It is conceivable that with the recognition and support of the foreign powers, some dictator may ultimately unify China under one government, but in the last analysis it can be achieved only by conquest and after a series of devastating wars eclipsing in horror all other wars in the history of the world. A government or empire created by force must be maintained by force. Another decade of civil warfare in China will convert the Chinese into a warlike nation, with an army thirsty for more lands to conquer.This is what unification by the sword means to China ; the continued degradation and enforced enslavement of a quarter of the human race to pay for the upkeep of the system which maintains them in bondage. Not until the rulers of China hold their office by the consent of the governed can the power of the militarist be broken.<br>Canton has broken away from Nanking and is preparing for another war to overthrow the dictatorship of the Chekiang oligarchy.Canton announces that it proposes to put an end to military rule in China, and establish a government of the people by the people and for the people. An excellent slogan with which to fool the masses and the outside world. It will be another century at least before the people of China can be educated in the rudiments of self government. With all available revenues being used to maintain the armies which keep the stupid people in subjection,there is little hope that any considerable sums will be available for any purpose that will tend to weaken the military system. With96 percent of illiteracy, it is hopeless to expect that the peoples of China, can manage their own affairs. They will remain slaves of the system that their ignorance, poverty and weakness has fastened upon them ; a system that has no more regard for their welfare than a ravenous tiger has for its prey.<br>Is there a remedy ? Is there any way to liberate the people of China from their present bondage ? How far is the outside world responsible for the present military system ? Are we justified in recognizing that the Chinese people constitute one nation whose territorial integrity is sacrosanct? Must we perpetuate the diplomatic absurdity that a country as large as a continent must be united under one government no matter what the cost to humanity? In pursuit of this mistaken policy evolved in the brain of an American statesman ignorant of the real facts, the preservation of China’s territorial integrity and her undiminished sovereignty over these regions has become a cardinal principle in Far Eastern diplomacy. Yet at the very time, the principle was announced, China had secretly handed over Manchuria to Russia under the terms of a military alliance designed to crush and humiliate Japan. Japan was bound hand and foot to respect the integrity of China, while China and Russia were secretly preparing to crush out her existence.<br>Japan is once more facing a similar menace to her security.Mongolia has been painlessly amputated from the main body ofChina and annexed to Soviet Russia. Sinkiang is going the sameway. The Barga region is slipping. The pressure of the Slavis slowly converting the outlying provinces of China into Sovietrepublics. The Mongols have asserted their right to self determination and the rest of the world has recognized the accomplished fact.When Sinkiang declares its independence, Moscow will recognize the new state and again the outside world will accept the inevitable. Moscow does not recognize the principle of China’s territorial integrity. Slowly, but surely the Communists are tearing China apart, while the other Powers adhere religiously to a worn out doctrine that no statesman has the courage to puncture.<br>In pursuit of the antiquated Hay Doctrine, obligations have been loaded on the people of China until now they constitute an almost unsurmountable barrier to any solution of China’s problem by the creation of three or more independent states. The foreign debt of China secured mainly on the Customs, is the sole cement which now binds the Powers together for the enforcement of a principle that to date has brought more misery, death and destruction to Asia than the Great War to Europe. And the end is not yet.<br>Loans, loans and more loans to the grand total of £150,000,000have been made to the various so-called governments of China in an endeavor to strengthen the central authority and give effect to a kindergarten doctrine, that the Chinese themselves ridicule and decline to accept. Russia alone understands the Chinese mentality and lack of national consciousness and in lopping off the outlying provinces and spreading her doctrines in other regions,she will ultimately succeed in her program of splitting the Mongolian race into its component parts, recognizing each as a distinct nationality and incorporating their territory into the system ofSoviet republics. The other foreign Powers, adhering to the diplomacy of John Hay must either recognize this trend in the affairs of China and shape their policies in harmony with realities,or they must give effect to the doctrine of China’s integrity by supporting materially and morally some one faction that can unify the country by the sword and so preserve the principle laid down in 1898. It is hardly probable at this late date that the Powers could be induced to co-operate along such lines. It has been tried time and again and has failed. If international financial support to the present recognized government is impractical, then we must face the other alternative and beat Moscow at its own game.<br>In 1924, Marshal Chang Tso-lin declared the independence of Manchuria. He refused to recognize the authority of Peking and in October of that year concluded an agreement with the Soviet Government, concerning the status of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which holds good to this day. Manchuria is still an independent state, linked to Nanking under the terms of an agreement that recognizes its rule over all of North China. Marshal Chang Hsuehliang is not a vanquished war-lord. He is the co-ruler of NationalChina, equal in rank and prerogatives to his military partner in Nanking. The rule of Nanking does not extend to Manchuria.They will not permit the Kuomintang officials to meddle in their affairs. The Northern Chinese look upon the Cantonese as worse‘foreign devils ’’ than the blue eyed barbarians from over the sea.Manchuria is independent, peopled by a race which has nothing in common with the peoples of Central or North China.<br>Whether the rest of the world likes it or not, the segregation of Manchuria into a distinct territorial division will sooner or later have to be recognized. This is the real issue betweenChina and Japan at the present moment. No new treaty of peace or commerce can be negotiated between China and Japan withoutChina’s full recognition of Japan’s legal rights in Manchuria.Japan is apparently willing to surrender all her special rights inChina Proper in return for the reciprocal right to reside in the interior, the right to own and lease property and engage in business,industry and agriculture. These privileges China refuses to concede until such time as Japan surrenders the lease to Liaotung and withdraws her troops from Manchuria. China stands firmly on her declared policy not to recognize the validity of the 1915 Treaty,while Japan just as firmly adheres to her acquired rights under that treaty. No statesman in Japan will discuss the subject.]The nation would rise as one man and go to war with the whole world before it surrenders the picayune fruits of its two previous sacrifices. To ask Japan to get out of Manchuria is to ask her to commit suicide. Japan will never recede from her position, go if the aspirations of National China are to be realized, she must be prepared to fight. The shadow of this conflict is upon us.Unless China recognizes Japan’s acquired rights in Manchuria,any incident may precipitate the crisis. Japan’s patience is almost exhausted. A few more Wanpaoshan incidents, a few more murders of Japanese officials, a few more open violations of treaties and agreements, may compel her to act. The situation is ominous, similar in every respect to the lull which preceded the Russo.Japanese conflict. Slowly, but surely Japan is building up herease. The Kellogg Peace Pact, the League of Nations or any other instrument for the abolition of war, will carry no weight when Japan decides that her national existence is at stake. No other nation will interfere in a dispute that will never be submitted to arbitration. The Manchuria problem will be settled on the field of battle. Unless we admit that China is in a position to vanquish Japan, is it worth while to carry the dispute to the stage where war is the only solution? Such a war can have only one ending and in the treaty of peace, Japan will collect the indemnity she was bunecoed out of at Portsmouth. China will lose Manchuria.<br>One way to avert such a war, is for the Powers to acknowledge the realities of the situation and recognize Manchuria as an independent state. Under new treaty relations with Japan and the other Powers, Manchuria will be saved from the Soviet, opened up to foreign capital and development and created into a strong buffer state between Japan and the Soviet or between the Soviets and North China. This is the only alternative to its ultimate incorporation into the Japanese Empire.<br>Canton has declared its independence but insists upon its right to re-conquer the rest of China and oust the Chekiang clique that stole the fruits of its former victory. That is the root of the trouble between Canton and Nanking. The Cantonese fomented a revolution; their armies subjugated the rest of China, but their Chekiang military leader, true to Chinese traditions and the call of the clan handed over the big jobs to his fellow provincials and family connections. The nimble-witted Cantonese were defrauded of the spoils of victory by the despised delta-folk of Chekiang. So they must fight the war “‘ to establish a government of, by and for the people of China ” all over again. God knows what it will cost the people of China to establish this glorious principle of democracy. Would it not be better for humanity if Canton’s independence was recognized by the foreign powers, on the condition that the new state agrees to assume its share of the foreign debt, join the League of Nations, sign the Kellogg Peace Pact and concentrate its energies on improving the welfare of its people! If we admit the right of the Mongols and Central Asian tribes in Sinkiang to apply the principle of self determination; if the successors of Chang Tso-lin can defy the power of the Central Government and preserve an autonomous existence, why should Canton be denied the same right? If the recognition of Canton as a sovereign state will be the means of putting a stop, even a temporary one, to these insensate internecine wars, humanity, common-sense and practical politics demands action along these lines.<br>An independent Canton, including Kwangsi, Yunnan and Kweichow, will provide the restless and progressive Cantonese the opportunity to show the world and the rest of China what can be done under a government of, by and for the people. GiveCanton a chance to work out a solution to this problem as a lesson to the more backward states of China. Under new treaties and guarantees, and a consolidation of its share of the foreign debt, there should be no reason why foreign capital should not flow into the South China Republic, develop its resources and open up 4 new era of prosperity to the tax-burdened peoples. Intervention, by recognition of the realities may be the only way left open to save China from splitting up into a congery of small Soviet republics tied to Moscow’s leading strings. The battle ground of communism for the control of Asia and the world is definitely fixed in China. Communism must be fought with its own weapons. If the Powers insist upon adhering to the outworn doctrine of John Hay, the Soviet will triumph. The country is too vast, the interprovincial jealousies and prejudices too bitter, to assure unity under one government. Only by the creation of at least four or five distinct compact states can the danger be now averted. Recognition of the realities is not intervention!</p><p name="bf09" id="bf09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The Far Eastern Review 1931.8<a href="https://archive.org/details/far-eastern-review-1931.8" data-href="https://archive.org/details/far-eastern-review-1931.8" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><br>https://archive.org/details/far-eastern-review-1931.8</a></p></div></div></section>
