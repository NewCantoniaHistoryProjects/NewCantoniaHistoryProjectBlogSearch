Sun wanted to unify the country by force, after which a centralized government would gradually develop a national democracy. My father advocated a province-level program of political, economic, and social reform that would achieve national unity in peaceful stages. He implemented his reform program in Guangdong, making that province a model for others in the first step toward a nationally federated China.<br>Chinese Nationalist (Guomindang) and Communist (Gongchandang) historians regard Sun Yat-sen as the founding hero of modern China, and so have vilified Chen, treating him as a warlord and one-time disciple of Sun who turned traitor. They have also suppressed or ignored the vibrant spirit of federalism that animated Chinese political life in the 1920s. As a consequence, the current generation of Chinese and most Western scholars know little about Chinese federalism and the figures who advocated it.<br>Born into a landlord family, my father received a traditional education, winning the first literary degree, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">xiucai</em>, at the age of twenty. He subsequently entered the Academy of Law and Political Science in Canton where he was formally introduced to Western learning. He exhibited an early interest in social welfare and reform, and once in political office he strove to implement his progressive ideas. He was deeply committed to the principle of self-government, starting at the lowest level, in the villages and counties. He believed that the key responsibility of the national government of a federation was to conduct national defense. Given the realities of China in the warlord period, my father believed that a federalist approach was the only feasible way to eventually establish a united, democratic republic. Beginning with Guangdong as a model province, he wanted to organize a “United States of China in the manner of the American experience” through negotiation with federalists from all parts of the country (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">New York Times</em> June 27, 1922).<br>My father’s approach conflicted directly with Sun Yat-sen’s plan to unify China by military force and impose a modern, centralized government on the entire nation. In 1924, having failed militarily, Sun reorganized the Nationalist Party after the Soviet model and accepted Chinese Communist Party members on a dual-membership basis. In return, Sun received Soviet financial and military aid. By the end of 1925, a Soviet-trained, Soviet-equipped cadet army under Sun’s successor, Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi), defeated Chen’s Guangdong Army and the forces of other provinces.<br>My father fled to Hong Kong where he continued the fight by political means. He transformed the largest secret society of overseas Chinese in the Americas and Southeast Asia into an open political party with well-defined democratic aims. He advocated extension of the federalist principle to all of Asia, Europe, and America, with the ultimate goal of a world federation of demilitarized nations.<br>This book deals with several major political and military activities of Sun Yat-sen, particularly in the 1920s, that were closely related to my father’s political career. They reveal a Sun Yat-sen different from the posthumous Sun, who was effectively canonized in 1925 and has been worshiped by both Nationalists and Communists as the source of political legitimacy since that time. The Nationalist government, which controls the bulk of the source material on this period and dominates its historiography, derives its legitimacy from the Revolution of 1911 and wants it treated in a manner that supports its claims. In their handling of Sun’s legacy over the years, the Nationalists have succeeded in determining not only how, but which, events are covered.<br>In writing this book I have sought to rescue the concept of Chinese federalism and the reputation of one patriot who espoused it. Initially I thought that this would be an impossible task: Most Chinese archives are not open to me, and the bulk of my father’s papers were lost in the flames of war.[1] Moreover, I wanted to free myself from the grip of the official history of this period.<br>When I began to delve into old newspaper collections and American and British consular reports, I was amazed at the abundance of information. I found not only eyewitness accounts, but also analysis from an era preceding the ascendancy of Nationalist and Communist historical dogma. I have, therefore, depended mainly on these primary sources — — diplomatic reports and documents from the American and British archives, articles in politically independent newspapers and journals published in Hong Kong and Shanghai, and private papers.[2]<br>A paper by Winston Hsieh published in 1962 remains the only Western scholarly work on my father’s political career that emphasizes his ideas and ideals. I have also benefited greatly from recent studies by B. Lawrence (1971, New York), Kang Baishi (1978, Hong Kong), Li Dajia (1986, Taiwan), Lee Ao (1987, Taiwan), Zhang Shiying (1994, Taiwan), and Prasenjit Duara (1995, Chicago).<br>Although my effort here cannot restore the reputation of the federalist movement or my father’s fellow federalists in other provinces, I do hope it will encourage other historians to reexamine the federalist perspective. The federalist movement in 1920s China was not, as Sun Yat-sen declared, “an efficacious charm for the militarists in their seizure of territories” (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">GFYJ</em>, 254; d’Elia 1974, 314); nor was it, as Nationalist and Communist historians have maintained, an abortive episode of regional militarism in the warlord era.<br>My father died when I was nine. I came to the United States in 1946, earned a doctorate in engineering, and retired from my profession four decades later in 1986. Over the years I had collected a considerable amount of material about my father and China’s early revolutionary period; after my retirement I began a systematic study of my father’s political career and the era in which he lived.<br>I am indebted to individuals too numerous to mention here, who helped clarify for me certain aspects of my father’s life and times. I would, however, especially like to mention the late Chen Yansheng of Hong Kong, Timothy T. Kao of the Gateway Community Technical College of Connecticut, the late C. Martin Wilbur of Columbia University, Winston Hsieh of the University of Missouri, Young-tsu Wong of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Lee Ao of Taiwan, and Li Dajia of Taiwan’s Academia Sinica — — I am deeply grateful to all of them. Professor Wilbur took the time to give my early manuscript a thorough and constructive review. Professor Kao has co-authored with me a biography of my father in Chinese. I would also like to thank Thomas F. Dorsey, a retired English teacher and an old friend and neighbor in East Lyme, Connecticut, who graciously agreed to help edit my manuscript.<br>I am indebted to two anonymous reviewers for the Center for Chinese Studies for their comments and constructive criticisms, which framed the final revision. I wish to thank Margaret Mirabelli who edited the revision and used her extraordinary skills and sense of style to improve my exposition. I am grateful to Professors Ernest P. Young and David Rolston for their invaluable comments and suggestions. And I am indebted to Terre Fisher and her assistant Julia Brooks at the Center for Chinese Studies Publications for the meticulous care they gave my final manuscript and for their constant support on the path to publication.<br>I wish to express my gratitude to my wife Pauline for her patience and devotion. Above all, I wish to express my sincerest appreciation and thanks to America, my adopted country, in which I raised my family and had the opportunity to write this book.</p><p name="17af" id="17af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leslie H.
