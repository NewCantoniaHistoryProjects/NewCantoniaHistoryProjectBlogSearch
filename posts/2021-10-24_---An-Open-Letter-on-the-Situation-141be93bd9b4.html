You appear to have lost your usual good humour, your calmness, and to a certain extent your good sense. Is it the crisis in China which is agitating you? I’m not surprised if that is the real cause of your uneasiness. It does seem hard upon you to be forced into this unfortunate embroglio before you have finally settled affairs in South Africa. You have my deepest sympathy. But don’t be annoyed if I tell you that this crisis should have been anticipated by you, and prevented too, if you had been less obstinate in taking sound advice and more firm in dealing with the Chinese authorities. You have been duped and imposed upon by interested persons who have selfish needs to serve. You have been led to believe that the weak and generous policy on your part would result in a better understanding and relationship between Great Britain and China, and that international commerce and inter-course would be improved thereby. On the one hand you have been lured with promises and prospects of extensive increase of trade and on the other threatened with disturbance and ultimate destruction of existing business on celestial soil. You did not know that your meekness has been regarded by the Chinese government as weakness and that your generosity and forbearance as signs of timidity and cowardice. Hence of late years you have had a succession of mishaps culminating in the present crisis. You failed also to recognise that your trade with China could only be materially developed by increasing the prosperity and welfare of the Chinese people which in turn depend upon the establishment of an enlightened government in the place of the present ignorant, corrupt and tyrannical regime.</p><p name="ccb3" id="ccb3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You are afraid that by disturbing the existing Government, bad though it be, you would injure your commerce and involve you in much trouble and expense. Indeed your apprenhension on this account had been so strong that you had endured many affronts and numerous acts of treachery from the rulers of the Middle Kingdom with scarcely an audible murmur. Further, you have apparently been returning good for evil and have a afforded material aid to the Central Government on several occasions in suppressing rebellions and disorder within its dominion. For this did you get any real thanks? For all your patience, long-suffering and good-will, did you get any credit? No, Friend Bull, I’m afraid you have been nursing a serpent in your bosom and it is striking you with its poisonous fangs. Turn over a new leaf, I pray you, and now you have the opportunity act vigorously, firmly and fearlessly. Trouble not over any temporary derangement of your trade, as it will all come right in the end. As soon as you have succeeded in rescuing the teeming millions of China from oppression and bad government you will not only earned the blessing of Heaven and the gratitude of the liberated, but you commerce will increase by leaps and bounds, and you will be richly repaid for all your trouble, expense and temporary losses. Besides, does it not seem rather selfish of you to merely make your fortune in China without doing something to ameliorate the miserable condition of its inhabitants? Do not your religion and civilization demands more of you?</p><p name="0db9" id="0db9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do not, Mr. Bull, be misled again as to the cause of the present trouble. You have been told I know, both officially and privately, that the whole affair was directly or indirectly caused by foreign missionaries and their converts. This is absolutely false and don’t you believe it. Your missionaries, with very few exceptions, are good and worthy men, and, if left to themselves, will make many more friends than enemies in China. But they have always been hated by the Mandarins and their underlings, by the literati and expectant officials, for bringing to the people of China not only religion but also enlightenment and civilisation, thus rendering them less amenable to the arbitrary and oppressive policies of their superiors, and more difficult to be squeezed and fleeced by their corrupt rulers. You must know that your missionaries do not simply preach the gospel, but they do a great deal of educational work among the natives, many of whom have doubtless derived from their foreign missionaries their first notion of the principles underlying good government, the necessity for reform, the right of personal liberty and of resisting unjust demands and impositions. All these must be detestable to the official and literary classes. They saw that your missionaries, though innocently enough, had been undermining their influences, and indirectly taught the masses to rebel against their authority. They further perceived that if the missionaries be permitted to go on preaching and teaching the people, they would one day lose all their opportunities and power of preying upon their subjects. Thus, for a longtime past, the mighty mandarins and literati have regarded the foreign missionaries as their deadly enemies, and have either covertly or openly stirred up the ignorant populace against them. Sometimes by false reports and infernal lies, other times by obscene and malicious writings, they worked upon the fear and superstitions of the people, and incited them to exterminate or drive out the missionaries. Frequently they aggravated the situation by publishing official proclamations which are couched in such ambiguous terms as to encourage instead of deter the rioters or by sending soldiers with such secret instructions as to cause them to assist in, rather than prevent the riotous proceedings. The present rising of the so-called Boxers against missionaries and native Christians has been gotup and supported by the high mandarins to drive out the missionaries. You might have had some doubt of this before, but recent disclosures and discoveries have, I hope, dispelled it from your mind. Read, John, the numerous Imperial edicts which have been translated and published in the newspapers and see how some of them extol and encourage the Boxers. Preuse, also the communications from Morrison of Times, and finally consider the proofs which were unearthed at the Viceroy’s Yamen at Tientsin.</p><p name="ab1f" id="ab1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here I wish also to disabuse your mind of some of the ridiculous charges made against your missionaries which seem to have obtained a certain degree of credence even among some of your leading men. The foreign missionaries have been charged with having committed acts of indiscretion inasmuch as they frequently preached against the ancient beliefs of the Chinese, as for instance, ancestral worship, and by such indiscreted acts they have stirred up the wrath of the Celestials against them. I beg to tell you that this is not a fact, and that the anger of our Chinese friends is not so easily and an unreasonably aroused. The mere speaking against a thing has never been regarded by the Chinese as a sufficient cause for hostile action or demonstration.</p><p name="7ab8" id="7ab8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, it will be different if the missionaries sought to force their doctrines upon the natives or endeavored forcibly to prevent them from worshipping their ancestors. The Chinese Buddhist priests have ever preaching against marriage, a very old and important institution amongst the Chinese; have you ever heard that the people of China rose against them for that? On the contrary, they have often lynched a Buddhist priest for breaking his vow of celibracy or for committing immorality. The Mahomedans have ever preached against the eating of pork, a very old and universal practice among the Chinese; for this were they ever attacked by the infuriated mob? The Vegetarian in China were also strong against the killing of any animal and consuming its flesh; was the anger of the Chinese roused against them on account thereof? No, Sir, the Chinese people are not so unreasonable as that. However if for the purpose of mining all of constructing a railway, you were foolish enough to remove their ancestral graves without previously obtaining their will and free consent, a serious disturbance might easily be created. But this is quite a different matter. Again, the missionaries have been charged with another indiscretion, viz, that they made no separation of the sexes in their places of worship, and that they themselves and their converts, both male and female, mixed freely together in company, which was regarded as an offense against Chinese customs and propriety, and so excited their ire. This is also a frivelous charge. The Chinese themselves, both men and women, often mingle together in worshiping in some of their temples. If you don’t believe it, please go to Chik Wan and witness the annual worship of the goddess of Heaven there. You will see crowds of Celestials, both male and female, performing their religious rites in the same building, and close to each other. Or you might go to a certain temple a little way from Canton, on the South Bank of the Pearl River, where an annual festival of lettuce-eating takes place. There you will find ladies and gentlemen of respectability kneeling side by side and one in front of the other before the joss. In the street of Shanghai, you will oftentimes see men and women undoubtedly of Chinese nationality, driving together in the same carriage, and in the native gardens there male and female co-mingle in the most unconcerned manner possible — — and they excite no ill remarks nor resentment from the public. I believe in the Canton province only are the women strictly secluded, but in other provinces they have much more liberty. But, after all, if the co-mingling of the sexes in places of worship and in society be an indiscretion, then every European and American living in China has been guilty of the same offence, and many Celestials themselves are equal sinners. Yet another charge against the missionaries. It is alleged that they have from time to time interfered in the litigations and with the dispensation of justice between native Christians and their conationals. This is a serious charge, if true. But first of all show me a single yamen in the whole of China whose justice is dispensed equitably between the litigants without fear or favour. Is it not notorious and bribery? The biggest purse will always win the suit, The suitors are not allowed to get legal experts to represent them in their cases, and the mandarins can deal with the matters coming before them in any way they chose. Under these circumstances it is quite possible and even probable that some of the native converts who have suffered injustice did lay their cases and their complaints before their respective foreign spiritual advisers and request them to make representations directly or indirectly to the proper authorities for redress and justice. It is also quite conceivable that some good-natured and zealous missionaries, sympathising with them regarding their grievances, did make the appeals on their behalf, and perchance obtain justice too. This is not interfering with the dispensation of justice, but assisting in procuring it. After all, please remember that this is only an unproven charge. The Chinese officials all know well that the foreign missionaries have no right to interfere in any legal case between native Christian and their countrymen, and if they had a clear conscience conscious and a clean hand, they could easily and at all times send the interfering missionaries about their business. During recent years we have heard a great deal of this charge against the missionaries, particularly the Roman Catholic missionaries, but I cannot recollect having heard that in a single case this charge has been substantiated and brought home to the offender. It is easy, of course, to make accusations, especially when the accusers wishes to find some excuse for his hatred of the accused, but the public wants absolute and tangible proof before they will give their credence and judgement.</p><p name="4f6d" id="4f6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The present crisis is then, after all, the direct outcome of the anti-foreign spirit and policy of the Central Government, whose ignorance, vanity and pride led them to believe that by one single effort they would drive off the foreigners from China or at all events make them so uncomfortable and scared that they would withdraw from the country on their own accord. This anti-foreign policy was foreshadowed last year by an Imperial Edict address to the Viceroys and Governors of the provinces, instructing them to deal vigorously with every foreign complication and authorising them to open hostility at the own discretion. The so-called Boxers were incited to rise and to go on with the murderous attack upon foreigners by some of the high and powerful magnates at Peking with the knowledge and sanction of the Empress Dowager. Yuk Yiu, the former Governor of Shantung, was one of the number. The origin of the Boxers 義和團 (I Wo Tun — — faithful and united band) or 義和拳 (I Wo Kun — — faithful and united fighters) is shrouded in mystery, notwithstanding the official statement that they are members of the Society specially formed to make war on the foreigner, missionaries and their converts on account of past injuries and quarrels. An Imperial edict states that the Society of boxers was in existence during the reign of Ka Hing and was supressed by that Emperor about 150 years ago. I question, however, the accuracy of this assertion. My reason for doing so is that the Manchu government could never have recognized and encouraged as they did a Society which had been suppressed by one of their former Emperors. Such an act would be in direct contravention of the tradition and rules of the Imperial Clans. Moreover, we have found no record of their formation, rising and suppression, and until last year no living person seem to have heard of their names.</p><p name="4028" id="4028" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From the very commencement I had a strong suspicion that this Society was got up by the partizans of the Empress Dowager to support her cause immediately after the coup d’etat, less than two years ago. At that time they attracted very little notice, and it was not till the latter part of last year, when an intention was manifested by the Dowager Empress to depose Kwang Su and place Prince Tun’s son on the throne, that they gave any sign of their existence and activity. The design to dethrone Emperor Kwang Su was vigorously resisted by some of the high ministers — — notably Liu Kwan I, the veteran Viceroy of Nankin — — and a number of Chinese officials and scholars, and their opposition was so strong that the scheme was abandoned for the time, and Tun’s son was merely made the heir apparent to the Throne — — an extraordinary — — proceeding in itself seeing that the reigning Emperor was scarcely thirty and a comparatively young man. After this, the organisation and spread of the Boxer Society became rapid as it was quite evident that the Dowager Empress party had urgent need of this support and cooperation. Further the name of the Society is rather suggestive. The residence of the Dowager goes by the name of 頤和園 (I Wo Yun), and any trained band designed for the guarding of her abode aptly be styled 頤和團 (I Wo Tun). The name of the Boxers, though differently written as far as the first character is concerned, corresponds nevertheless very near in sound to that of a guard of the Dowager palace. Recent disclosures and events have confirmed me in my suspicion. Of one thing however, I am certain that a strict investigation into the various Imperial edicts concerning the Boxers, the incriminating documents found at the Viceroy’s yamen at Tientsin and the testimony of eye-witnesses, including the foreign Minsters themselves, will reveal to the fullest extent the culpable complicity of the Central Government in the rising and misdeeds of the Boxers.</p><p name="e6da" id="e6da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How to deal with the present crisis will doubtless exercise your mind not a little. Of course you must capture not only Peking, but also the lawless band of mandarins and their confederates the leading Boxers. You must also have enough military forces in China to see that the various provincial authorities do keep the peace in their respective localities. After this you might think of the all important and absorbing question; what to do with China and its 400,000,000 inhabitants? I take it that you are well agreed upon the principles so fearlessly propounded by your Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs that China shall be for the Chinese, and there will be no partition of the Middle Kingdom by the Foreign Powers. The Indianising of China you will not have, but then you must not go to the other extreme to leave China severely alone and permit her to get along as before. Otherwise you will have a repetition of the present trouble at no distant date and may be something worse into the bargain. The present rotten and corrupt system of government must go and radical reforms should be introduced. It will not do after having vindicated your honour to make a hollowpeace with the Chinese Government, exact an indemnity, sign a new treaty, have some more ports opened to trade, get more concessions, and then let the Manchu Government do as they like thereafter. Pray remember that Manchus are not Chinese, and it will only be fair to leave China for the Chinese and Manchuria for the Manchus. All the enlightened sons of China are earnestly looking to and praying Great Britain and United States of America for deliverance from the yoke of an oppressive and corrupt Government. If emancipated their gratitude to their deliverers will be lasting and boundless, but if they be left to the tender mercies of an unreformed and corrupt government as before, they will rise up to a man and do their utmost in gaining their just rights and liberty. I sincerely beg you to give no heed to bad counsels tendered to you by inexperienced persons or by interested parties. You may be advised that China does not require a radical reformed government. But only a strong Central Government backed up by a large and disciplined army to maintain order within its territories. They will try to persuade you that the present crisis would never have happened had the Government at Peking been supported by a numerous and effective army. Please do not listen to this. Recent events show that the Peking Government have not hesitated to employ the very troops which you and other foreigners have trained for them to do you mischief. The very guns with which you had supply them were turned upon your soldiers. Hence your casualties in killed and wounded in the various engagements at Taku, Tientsin and Peitsang were so unusually heavy. I put it to you is it not foolish as well as dangerous at all times to teach naughty children the use of firearms or to put into their hands dangerous weapons and implements? Reform the Government first, I say, and then precure them a fine army afterwards. Besides in the name of God what right have you or anybody else to supply a tyrannical and notoriously corrupt Government with the means of keeping its subjects in abject misery and subjections? Some again may suggest to you that it would be better for you to leave the regeneration of the Chinese alone otherwise they may get to be so enlightenedand powerful as to become a menace and a positive danger to the whole world. Don’t you be frightened by this pure alarmist’s suggestion for these reasons. Firstly, it will take centuries to make China a very powerful nation. Secondly, the Chinese are not a war-like and aggressive race, they are mostly composed of peaceful scholars, traders, agriculturists and they are generally contented with what they do. Thirdly, as the Chinese advance in wealth and strength other nations are not stationary and the relative position will be maintained centuries hence. Fourthly, Chinese of different provinces have their several distinctive characteristics and in the distant future they are more likely to separate into distinct statesthan to unite into an immense nation. Once more, Sir, it may be represented to you that the task of reforming China is tremendous and that it would be opposedby other foreign nations. To save trouble and possible complications with the European powers you will be urged to allow matters in China to drift on as before. Let me assure you most sincerely that the task of reforming China is not so great as you may imagine. China is about ripe for reformation and many of her intelligent and gifted sons are most enthusiastic over it. Their cooperation maybe counted on and with it the labour will become easy and profitable. I very much doubt whether any foreign power would actively and openly oppose the much desired reformation seeing that the benefits resulting therefrom will be shared by all alike. But whatever may be the opposition I feel sure that if Great Britain and America led the way, Japan will fall in readily enough, and after all the Far Eastern Question will have to be settled mainly by these three powers conjointly as they are the most interested parties.</p><p name="9535" id="9535" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lastly, as regards the sort of reform you should introduce into China and the form of Government you might establish, I regret that I have neither the time nor space here to touch upon them but I may refer you to the two leading articles published in the China Mail on the 1st and 4th of August 1900, respectively. In them you will find many suggestions for your consideration and adoption.</p><p name="8c85" id="8c85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">(China Mail, 1900.8.22)</p></div></div></section>
