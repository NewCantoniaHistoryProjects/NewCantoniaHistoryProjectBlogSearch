On the one side were the merchants — — or rather, their Volunteer Corps — — and on the other was the Canton Government, where mercenaries carried out its bidding, assisted the rabble of the city.</p><p name="e302" id="e302" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">$7,000,000 Damage</strong></p><p name="c6a7" id="c6a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The latest position is best summed up in the following message courteously handed to the “China Mall”:</p><p name="581f" id="581f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At about noon to-day the two Chinese members of Council received the following news about Canton from the Hon. Colonial Secretary:</p><p name="d8a3" id="d8a3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Latest intelligence from Canton received by the Naval Authorities is that a large fire raged yesterday but is now under control. The Merchants Volunteers have been defeated. The damage is estimated at $7,000,000, and the loss of life is probably large. All is now quiet.”</p><p name="ed7e" id="ed7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Treachery.</strong></p><p name="723e" id="723e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Owing to the unfortunate interruption to the telegraph service between Hongkong and Canton, this Colony was kept in suspense till after mid-night last night when, on the arrival of the night boats from Canton, some news was gathered. Since then hardly anything has dribbled through but we are authentically informed that although the worst was feared the<br>trouble did not spread last night as expected and that the resistance of the merchants has been broken, leaving the Government the<br>victors.</p><p name="2882" id="2882" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most surprising of all has been the treachery of the Cantonese troops under General Li Fook-lam(ruler of Honam and the new Mayor) who instead of assisting the merchants, openly attacked them and took a leading hand in the looting. The attitude taken by the two Yunnanese peacemakers-General Fan Shek-sang and Lieut-General Liu Hang-chiu — was also unexpected. It was thought that knowing which side of their bread was buttered, they would at least be sympathetic towards the merchants but they were content to guard their own “spheres” and in some instances, their men joined hands with attacking pro-Government troops.</p><p name="8bff" id="8bff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Effect of Gunboats</strong></p><p name="15e3" id="15e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In an extra issued to-day, the “Wah Tsze Yat-Po” hints that Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s cruiser, the “Wing Fung” was prevented from joining the fray by the “proximity of two foreign gunboats which signified that it had better not open fire.”</p><p name="cc0a" id="cc0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At 10 last night the beats from Hongkong left as usual and they should have arrived there this morning. Hardly any passengers shipped but a few Europeans made the journey. The boats which left on Tuesday and reached Canton yesterday morning had difficulty in getting alongside but their passengers refused to leave the ships and were ultimately brought back to Hongkong. A few left the ships from the “offside” and proceeded by sampan to Honam Island — across the river where it was quiet and where thousands of people stood watching the fighting on the Bund.</p><p name="0aae" id="0aae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">March to Canton?</strong></p><p name="e902" id="e902" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yunnanese and other troops were last reported as heavily guarding all approaches to Canton, particularly the Canton-Samshui Railway, along which the Merchants Volunteers and Village Guards assembled at Fatshan can move rapidly along to strike at Canton.</p><p name="fe3d" id="fe3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There seems little doubt that the backbone of the merchants has been broken and that almost unbearable terms will be exacted in addition to the Volunteers being deprived of their arms. But their colleagues, the Village Guards, are all trained-fighters, all having been in action against bandits and pirates. The anti-Sun press predicts that the Village Guards of the whole province, said to number over 40.000, will certainly march on Canton. If so, peace is not yet in sight.</p><p name="7323" id="7323" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Fighting Described</strong></p><p name="c945" id="c945" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our special correspondent, writing at 4 p.m. yesterday about the fighting, says:</p><p name="4f4d" id="4f4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">About 5:30 this morning, fighting broke out between the Merchants Volunteers and the Bolshevist Government which had officially declared the Volunteers “disbanded” and had given definite orders to different troops to storm the city and disarm the merchants. A most elaborate plan was prepared, including even the armed launches and the forts down to the mouth of the Canton River at Bocca Tigris.</p><p name="715f" id="715f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fighting has continued, intermittently, all day and even now shots can be heard from several directions. Nevertheless, the ubiquitous European aod American business man walked along the Bund all day as though nothing had happened.</p><p name="a7eb" id="a7eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From the Hotel Asia, along the Bund, the whole length of Shakee(facing Shameen) to the outskirts of the city, Yunnanese soldiers were on guard and firing away. At first it was not known if they were trying to dislodge the merchants or to repulse the other regular troops, but later on it became apparent that they were not on the side of the merchants Nevertheless they prevented other detachments from entering their lines.</p><p name="fb00" id="fb00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Soldiers were posted on the top of the Sun building and at the entrance to all side streets and making disconcerted efforts to get inside. Volunteers were stoutly defending their barricades, hoping for reinforcements from the Yunnanese, or Li Fook-lam, or the Village Guards.</p><p name="7507" id="7507" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Vitriol Used</strong></p><p name="243e" id="243e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Firing had continued for upwards or two hours before the Government regulars could make any headway. The Volunteers, receiving their baptism of fire, gradually fell back from advanced posts and retired on the centre of<br>the Western Suburb, which was strongly entrenched.</p><p name="0c91" id="0c91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Companies from Wu Te-chen’s Red Army acted as pioneers for the Regulars, as did Labourers who, armed with house-breaking Implements, broke down barricades. Not far from the Asia Hotel, a platoon of Merchants held their defences by throwing vitriol at the attackers who retaliated by rushing into a teahouse from which they procured dozens of kettles full of boiling water which they threw back at the<br>defenders.</p><p name="42d5" id="42d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was noticed that the Volunteers were mostly on house-tops all connected by a system of overhead bridges extending all over Western Suburb. When it found that street fighting was not successful, fires broke simultaneously in at last seven places in the city causing confusion to the Volunteer defenders. As fighting was going on little could be done towards putting out the fires and the Volunteers continued to fall back. Bit by bit the regulars advanced and by nine o’clock had taken the outskirts.</p><p name="25d3" id="25d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Looting Breaks Out</strong></p><p name="e6aa" id="e6aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then commenced a rush for Honam, via the Bund which was guarded by Government troops. Helpless civilians, with probably all they could rescue from their burnt homes, were searched and plucked ruthlessly. Soldiers began to get out of hand, breaking into shops and coming out with all they could get. A tea-house behind the Asia Hotel was entered four times, the merchants taking with them, hams, cakes, etc., blankets and even empty teachests.</p><p name="e0a0" id="e0a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With the high range of buildings on the water-front, it was difficult for artillery to be used but I have heard several speak of machineguns being used in desperate street fighting.</p><p name="707d" id="707d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gradually the firing died away and the fires continued, these being seen across the river.</p><p name="ef9f" id="ef9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Extra guards were posted along the Shameen water-front but there was no disorder at the bridge-heads. Tungshan, where many Europeans live, is also quite safe.</p><p name="4a0a" id="4a0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">LATER.</strong></p><p name="b36e" id="b36e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Merchants Volunteers have not been wholly diarmed, according to information reaching the “China Mail” this afternoon.</p><p name="52d0" id="52d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">摘自The China Mail, 1924–10–16</p></div></div></section>
