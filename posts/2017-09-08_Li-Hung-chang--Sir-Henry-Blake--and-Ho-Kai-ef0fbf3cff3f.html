The Boxer rising, which split Chinese officialdom and drew the wrath of the foreigners upon the dynasty, provided an ideal context for Sun’s second attempt. The same embittered peasants whom Sun had earlier tried to enlist against the dynasty, joined the Boxer movement, (as will be explained in the next chapter) and their outburst manifested widespread hostility to the forced penetration of China by Western religion and commerce. Since 1899 reactionary officials, including a Peking Manchu faction led by Kang-i and Prince Tuan, had relied upon the Boxers, originally constituted as an ordinary secret society, as the ultimate weapon against the foreign threat. Other court officials and influential governors-general realized the folly of provoking the foreigners and attempted to suppress the movement. However, with the aid of their patrons in the capital, the Boxers dominated Peking and its environs by June. The Empress Dowager, mistakenly convinced that the foreign powers were bent upon her replacement, gave the movement her blessing. As the Boxers massacred Chinese Christians, destroyed foreign property, and threatened the lives of foreign missionaries and diplomats, an international relief force attempted to fight its way to Peking from Tientsin. On June 18, this British-led column was attacked by Chinese troops. On the 20th, the foreign legations in Peking were besieged by the Boxers, and on the next day, the Chinese government declared war against the foreign powers.<br>But anti-Boxer officials, led by Li Hung-chang and other provincial leaders, refused to acknowledge the declaration of war. Displaying shrewd diplomatic skill, this peace faction, which controlled China’s overseas envoys, argued that the throne had not authorized the war. The Boxers and their patrons, they declared, were actually rebels. As long as these provincial officials suppressed Boxerism and other demonstrations of anti-foreignism, the foreigners were willing to accept the “rebellion” connotation and to restrict their belligerency to the north. Understandably, however, foreigners kept a wary watch on the behavior of these moderates who coupled their defiance of Peking’s orders with protestations of loyalty to the dynasty.<br>As this extraordinary and highly delicate situation evolved, Sun Yat-sen discerned two lines of approach. He could seek collaboration with the powerful regional leaders, whose opposition to Boxerism threatened to sever their formal ties to Peking; or he could woo the invading foreigners, either on his own, or in alliance with a defecting official. There were various sub-plots to Sun’s maneuvers, but all were linked to these two main considerations.<br>First there was renewed hope in Li Hung-chang, who had been appointed Governor-General of the Liang-Kwang provinces at the end of 1899. While Li and other southern leaders were recoiling from the xenophobic fever gripping Peking, Liu Hsüeh-hsün, the opportunistic lottery manager, opened negotiations with Sun.<br>Except for a mysterious visit to Japan in August 1899, when he sought Sun’s help in meeting Inukai and Okuma, nothing had been had been heard from Liu Hsüeh-hsün since the Canton episode of 1895. At the end of May or the beginning of June 1900, as an official in Li Hung-chang’s yamen, he wrote to Sun that his chief was thinking of declaring the independence of his two provinces and wanted Sun’s participation. He invited Sun to Canton for a parley.<br>Was Liu acting on behalf of Li, or as the agent of the Can-tonese gentry, who wanted to be dissociated from the imminent Boxer war? Or was the invitation actually a trap? With officials and gentry occupied by the Boxer crisis, it seemed unlikely that Sun’s capture still rated high priority, but it was a possibility which could not be discounted. Sun nevertheless decided that the offer was worth exploring. On June 8, he sailed for Hong Kong on a French steamer, the S.S. Indus, with Ch’en Shao-pai, Cheng Shih-liang, Miyazaki, and two other Japanese, Kiyofuji Koshichiro and Uchida Ryohei. They arrived on June 17. Although registered as “Dr. Nakayama” from Yokohama, Sun could not risk landing, and held an hour-long deliberation in a sampan with his two followers, and Hirayama, who had pre-ceded them to Hong Kong, Yang Ch’ü-yün, and Tse Tsan-tai. Finally it was decided that Miyazaki, Kiyofuji, and Uchida, who under extraterritoriality were immune to Chinese arrest, should first meet Liu before Sun exposed himself. Liu had sent a gun-boat which now conveyed the three Japanese to his spacious quarters.<br>What exactly ensued in the all-night discussion is not clear, but Liu apparently told Sun’s emissaries that until Peking was occupied by the allied powers, the political situation would be in flux and that the governor-general could not commit himself. On the following day, Li Hung-chang received instructions from the court to return to Peking. This was the first intimation that his services were needed in the capital, and until he discerned the purpose for which he was wanted, to help wage the war which he opposed or parley for the peace which he sought, there was no need to commit himself to the drastic course of separatism.<br>Sun could not wait for his friends’ return, but had to sail with the Indus, when it left for Saigon on the 18th. He was accompanied by Mulkern, who had kept his London promise and be-come the only Westerner actually to join the Hsing Chung Hui. As the ship departed, it was sighted by Miyazaki’s party on their way back, and a few days later Sun was telegraphed the results of the conference. He himself sent a wire to Liu soon after his arrival in Saigon on June 21, an indication that Sun did not feel that the door to Canton was closed. Peking’s declaration of war against the foreign powers on the 21 st may have led him to believe that Li Hung-chang would finally decide to declare independence.</p><p name="b40b" id="b40b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Competition from the Pao Huang Hui<br>While Li’s decision was pending, Sun and his lieutenants pursued yet another course — the well worn path to K’ang Yu-wei. Since the end of January 1900, K’ang had been living in Singapore after a brief visit in Hong Kong on his way back from Canada. Despite the disappointments of the past, there were compelling reasons for Sun and Miyazaki to decide upon a further attempt to negotiate with K’ang.<br>First, renewed negotiations with the reformers might be considered tangential to the effort directed toward Li Hung-chang and Liu Hsüeh-hsün. If the Cantonese gentry were bent upon breaking away from Peking, then Cantonese reformers could be just as helpful as revolutionaries. According to Japanese investigators, this was in fact the expressed desire of the gentry at the Liu-Miyazaki conference, and they are said to have supplied Miyazaki with a peace offering for K’ang and a promise that additional funds would be sent to Singapore.<br>Second, and most important, the revolutionaries were losing to the Pao Huang Hui in the race for hua-ch’iao money. In addition to the Yokohama take-over, K’ang had done well in Canada, where he dazzled the hua-ch’iao merchants and peddlers with his imperial credentials. He raised $7,000 and formed Pao Huang Hui branches in Vancouver and Victoria. He was also doing well in Singapore under the sponsorship of wealthy hua-ch’iao like Ch’iu Shu-yüan (Khoo Seek Wan), heir to one of the great fortunes in the Straits Settlements. An even more alarming development, however, took place in Hawaii.<br>After the first few months of 1900 came the news that Liang, instead of breaking with K’ang, had raised havoc with the Hsing Chung Hui. Soon after arriving in Honolulu, Liang had written Sun that circumstances dictated devious measures but that he still hoped they could cooperate. He was obsessed with the problem “day and night” and begged for time while he worked out a satisfactory solution. But when he discovered the potency of the “protect the emperor” slogan, his desire for cooperation rapidly cooled. The Hawaiian hua-ch’iao responded with a wave of enthusiasm which almost drowned out the memory of Sun Yat-sen. The Pao Huang Hui branches which Liang established were not only more successful than the Hsing Chung Hui, but were even led mainly by Sun’s former disciples. Among those drawn away by Liang was Chung Kun Ai, one of Sun’s closest friends, who provides a first-hand account of Liang’s success:<br>Without previous announcement Liang Ch’i-ch’ao came to Honolulu as a political refugee. The news spread like wildfire …. Everyone wanted to meet this famous reformer. I too called and fell under the spell of the man. A group of us were so enthusiastic that we formed a branch of the “Protect Emperor Party” …. We collected subscriptions to send to the main bodies in Macao and Hong Kong. In all, I must have sent $30,000 of our currency. Liang himself was in great demand as a speaker. His intimate, behind-the-scene sketches of political intrigue and corruption in Peking, his picture of the pitiful Emperor Kuang-hsü imprisoned in a small pavilion in the South Lake within the Forbidden City, and his outline of the reforms that would be necessary to make China a modern country; these and other talks kept our enthusiasm at white-heat. . . . Many persons gave Liang money for his personal use …. <br>Even worse, Sun’s brother, Sun Mei, assumed leadership of the Pao Huang Hui branch in Maui and contributed $1,000. Sun’s letter of introduction, which Liang did not mention to his friends in Hong Kong and Macao, facilitated this relationship, but even so it seems that Sun Mei, no less than the other hua-ch’iao, was overawed by the presence of a self-styled imperial emissary who carried prestige which Sun Mei’s brother could never provide. Over Yat-sen’s objections, Sun -Mei later sent his son to Liang’s Ta-t’ung school in Japan.<br>Liang’s great success was also due to the timing of his visit. His arrival practically coincided with the imperial decree which named Prince Tuan’s son heir-apparent to the throne, a move interpreted as a death sentence for the imprisoned emperor. Liang himself felt the urgency of his mission and imparted his concern to the hua-ch’iao, who thrilled to the idea of aiding in the emperor’s rescue. Liang began organizing in January 1900, and six months later, he was still on hand to capitalize upon the latest excitement, the Boxer uprising.<br>Since Sun had last been in Hawaii, the annexation of the Islands by the United States, bringing with it the application to Hawaii of the notorious American exclusion law, had intensified hua-ch’iao nationalism. Only a few weeks after Liang’s arrival, the American health authorities, while fighting an outbreak of bubonic plague, accidentally set fire to the entire Honolulu Chinatown. Chinese property-owners incurred damages estimated at three million dollars, and compensation was not only slow in coming, but inadequate. Exploiting the bitter anti-American reaction, Liang promised that once the emperor was restored, foreigners — in his letters he would sometimes call American “white bandits” (pai-tsei) — would no longer dare “insult” the Chinese, whether at home or overseas, with impunity.<br>But there was more to Liang’s success than a combination of fortuitous circumstances and high connections. He succeeded because he was convinced that the time had come for the use of force, and the pragmatic, activist mood which governed his behavior led him to not only emulate Sun Yat-sen’s tactics, but to surpass them. Like Sun, he used projected military campaigns to attract hua-ch’iao support, and in addition to the Yangtze Valley plot already under way, he pressed for an attack on Kwangtung.<br>He concluded from his study of strategy that one of the reasons for the Taiping defeat was the failure to secure their southern base. Like Sun, he realized that action in their home province was more likely to attract hua-ch’iao money and fighters. He even joined the Triads, when he found that the secret society claimed the allegiance of most of the Hawaiian hua-ch’iao. Despite his uncle’s influence with the secret society, Sun had not yet taken this step. That Liang did so, even when anticipating K’ang’s disapproval, reflects his bold endorsement of unconventional methods. Though he admitted that activating the Ko Lao Hui was potentially dangerous, he warned K’ang that this was not the time to stand on principle and rely only upon his purebred disciples. <br>Again like his rival, Liang recognized the need for courting foreign support. Not all foreigners were enemies, he lectured his colleagues, and he urged that they establish a foreign language newspaper to improve external relations. Once the fighting started, he urged that they issue a proclamation promising the fulfillment of European claims and demands. And in a move characteristic of Sun Yat-sen, Liang engaged an American businessman, reputedly connected with the Secretary of State and strongly recommended by the hua-ch’iao, to act as his agent in the United States. If the Americans invested money in the proemperor movement, Liang argued, they would eventually throw in men and arms to protect their investment. He also advocated recruiting Filipino and Japanese fighters, again an idea originally conceived by Sun Yat-sen.<br>But if Liang matched Sun’s activist mood and his talent for imaginative scheming, he nevertheless adhered to the political aims of K’ang Yu-wei. On April 28, 1900, making his last conciliatory gesture to Sun, Liang wrote that the entire country was agitated by the rumored threat to the emperor’s life, and that those who wanted to save the emperor were “as plentiful as tall grass looking for rain.” The pro-emperor slogan, he wrote, was too valuable to be sacrificed, and though he too admired republicanism, he felt it could best be realized by first restoring the emperor to power, and then making him president of the republic. Thus the aims of both groups would be satisfied, and together they could raise an irresistible force of “ten million” men.<br>There is no record of Sun’s reply, if any, to this proposal. It was clear to Sun, however, that Liang would never repudiate K’ang Yu-wei. Sun had always favored cooperation, but Liang had repeated the Yokohama school take-over on a grand scale. It was especially bitter that, by convincing the hua-ch’iao that an armed struggle to save the Kuang-hsü Emperor was the same as conducting a revolution, Liang had robbed Sun of his most exclusive claim. In fact, the thin line separating “reform” and “revolution” had become blurred during this first half of 1900, when Liang and his Hunan-Hupeh friends were acting just as militantly as Sun Yat-sen. There was a real danger that Sun would be pushed out of the picture while the scholar reformers became activists. Even his own camp was not free from dissension; one maverick was Tse Tsan-tai, who in April suggested to<br>Yang Ch’ü-yün that the senior returned-student, Yung Wing, be elected “President of the United Reform Parties.” In these circumstances, Sun favored a further appeal to K’ang. The monarchical-republican issue may not have been of paramount importance then, since there was a strong possibility that the emperor would not live long enough to be rescued. The main effort was to coordinate his own bid for power with the planned reformist risings in the south and along the Yangtze. Though dismayed by Liang’s inconstancy, Sun felt that the situation might be saved by direct negotiations with K’ang.<br>But how would Sun reconcile the results of these negotiations with those still pending with Li Hung-chang? Possibly the Cantonese gentry desired K’ang’s inclusion. Surprisingly enough, there is also evidence that Li himself was surreptitiously maintaining contact with the reformers after they had fled from China, and even as late as the spring of 1900, Liang replied politely to a friendly gesture from Li via Japanese intermediaries. Yet despite these hesitant efforts at fence-mending dictated by the uncertain course of Chinese politics, there was overwhelming evidence of an unrelenting animosity between Li and the reformers. Li had been assigned to Kwangtung for the express purpose of stamping out the subversive activities of both K’ang and Sun. And he appeared to be performing this task with ruthless efficiency as far as the Pao Huang Hui was concerned. Relatives of overseas members had been arrested, and an attempt on K’ang’s life in Hong Kong earlier in the year was suspected to have been inspired by the Canton yamen. Although he had assured Governor Blake of Hong Kong that he had rejected an offer to have K’ang assassinated, Li added 40,000 taels to the 100,000 taels which Peking had placed on K’ang’s head. Li and even more his right-hand man, Liu Hsüeh-hsün, were considered the stumbling blocks to the pro-emperor forces in Kwangtung, and, writing from Hawaii, Liang pressed for their assassination. The hua-ch’iao, incensed over the reprisals against their relatives, could have been expected to shower the Pao Huang Hui with contributions had it delivered the heads of Li and Liu.<br>While Sun could not resist a cautious nibble at the Canton bait, there was thus little chance that K’ang would touch it even from a distance. Liang may have on one occasion favored sparing Li Hung-chang and using him as a puppet to placate foreigners and local gentry, come the revolution, but neither he nor K’ang felt Sun’s compulsion to join forces with prominent officials . K’ang did not need the prestige of Li or any other governor-general, but on the contrary, jealously guarded his claim to the emperor’s confidence and sought to disqualify the southern officials from participation in a projected reformist government. He was in fact already acting like the premier of a government in exile, while Sun was seeking high and low for a toehold in the gentry-dominated political structure. In this political setting, Miyazaki set out for Singapore to negotiate with K’ang on Sun’s behalf. In the end, K’ang’s haughty intransigence, as well as his fears, turned Miyazaki’s mission into a fiasco.<br>Accompanied by Kiyofuji and Uchida, Miyazaki arrived at the colony on June 29, 1900. When he wrote to K’ang asking for an interview, he was politely but firmly put off, the excuse being that K’ang was so well-guarded by the British that he could not receive visitors. Actually, K’ang had already been warned by letter and telegram from Hong Kong that a party of Japanese were on their way to assassinate him, and it can be assumed that the fears of his associates were based upon knowledge of the earlier meeting with Liu Hsüeh-hsün. As Miyazaki renewed his pleas for a meeting, K’ang’s suspicions grew and on July 5 the British police went into action.<br>Here we should point out that the British, despite the anti-foreign tenor of some of K’ang’s Chinese articles and the ridicule with which the Foreign Office generally greeted his pompous pronouncements, were much more solicitous of his welfare than they were of Sun’s. The fact that K’ang supported the emperor, still the legitimate ruler of China, made it difficult to treat him as an ordinary rebel, even though they feared that friendliness toward him would enable other powers to persuade the Chinese that they were “encouraging … the overthrow of the existing order … in China.” Governor Blake of Hong Kong had provided K’ang with armed guards against Manchu assassins, and in Singapore, where K’ang had arrived on January 31, 1900, Sir James Alexander Swettenham, Governor of the Straits Settlements, had followed London’s instructions and sent a detachment of Sikhs to protect him.<br>While the police prepared affidavits to support an order of banishment against Miyazaki and party, a Japanese interpreter whom they employed warned his compatriots of what was brewing. This may have been the reason for Uchida’s sudden departure on July 6, but Miyazaki, who had escorted K’ang to his haven in Japan just a year and a half previously, was disturbed by the assassination plot rumor and sent another letter to the reformer deploring police intervention and claiming the support of Ōkuma and ltagaki. On July 6, however, the warrants were ready and Miyazaki and Kiyofuji were taken into custody.<br>When the Japanese were searched, K’ang’s alarm appeared to be well-grounded. Two “sharp and clean” samurai swords, one claimed by each, a dagger, claimed for Uchida, and more than $27,000 in Hong Kong and Shanghai currency were found by the police. It was also discovered that they had been sending and receiving telegrams in cipher. The impression they made under interrogation only confirmed police suspicions. Although K’ang had put a wrong construction on their business with him, they did not wish to disclose its nature to the British and instead took refuge in a flimsy tale which made them even more suspect. Their story had apparently been agreed upon ahead of time since they told practically the same thing, though examined separately. They had left Japan, they maintained, in the company of Uchida, who was on a mission to China on behalf of his uncle, the Kyushu mine-owner Hiraoka. Uchida and Kiyofuji were to go to Kweichow or Szechwan in order to buy mining concessions with $20,000 of the money in their possession, and Kiyofuji was to remain there as a school teacher. Miyazaki introduced himself as a newspaper correspondent carrying money subscribed by his friends before he left Japan. The three had decided to come to Singapore to “see a new place,” and once they were there, Miyazaki felt it his duty to renew his acquaintance with K’ang Yu-wei.<br>In addition to being a journalist, Miyazaki described himself as an election agent and “prodigal,” who in the last five years had spent $200,000 which friends had given him. As for the swords, they both contended that no Japanese gentleman ever traveled without one.<br>On the same day, July 6, Sun Yat-sen left for Singapore accompanied by Mulkern and two Japanese, Fukumoto Nichinan and Ozaki Yukimasa, who had followed him to Saigon. After all these years, he still looked forward to his first meeting with K’ang Yu-wei. But when they arrived three days later, Sun’s immediate request for an interview met with an even colder rebuff than in the past. And of course Sun tried to look up his Japanese friends. When he and his party discovered that Miyazaki and Kiyofuji were under arrest, their first reaction was to seek the fastest transportation out of Singapore. But when the Japanese consulate informed them of the reason for the arrests, Sun was confident he could clarify the matter. He approached the British through the Japanese consulate and on July 10 made a statement in the presence of Swettenham and two other members of the Committee of the Executive Council. Since the Manchus were at war with Britain, Sun decided that at least a partial disclosure of his plans would be the best way to secure his friends’ release.<br>Miyazaki and Kiyofuji, he stated, had come with him to Hong Kong from Japan in order to protect him as they had previously protected K’ang. He too was wanted by the Manchus, though the reward was only a third of that offered for K’ang. Miyazaki, he said, was his “great companion” and a “gentleman” whose acquaintance he had made through Inukai and who was being supported by a rich Japanese and some mine owners. “He is useful in Chinese political matters I cannot explain,” Sun went on, and “he is afraid of injuring my cause; that is why he tells lies.” As for the money in the prisoners’ possession, Sun was quite sure that some of it was his and some subscribed, but none of it was Hiraoka’s.<br>In addition to vouching for his Japanese friends, Sun used the occasion to let the British know he was trying to exert a sobering influence upon the Chinese masses. He came to Singapore, he explained, to see K’ang Yu-wei and to recruit followers. Though K’ang did not share his anti-Manchu policy, he wanted to talk things over and arrange for joint action. The Chinese people, he asserted, were bound to rise sooner or later, but he was trying to pacify them and provide leadership. Although ultimately he hoped to crush the Peking regime, his immediate object was to form an independent southern government. He promised that his movement would not create much of a disturbance but “without this, China cannot be reformed.” He claimed a well-organized following in several of the southern provinces and boasted that the present quiet was largely due to their not moving. Sun believed that all the insurgents, “except for K’ang’s party, perhaps,” could be united into one body. They shared the fear that China would be partitioned and some of his men were pressing for action. If nothing were done, he was afraid they would go over “to the other side” (i.e., the Boxers).<br>Swettenham, however, still felt that the presence of the Japanese was undesirable, fearing that if they were not able to convince<br>K’ang to join Sun, they would use violence to prevent him from interfering with their plans. In addition, he suspected them of planning to purchase arms in Singapore and to use the colony as a base for Sun’s uprising. On July 11, therefore, Miyazaki and Kiyofuji were informed they were to be banished from Singapore for five years, and, on the basis of information supplied by K’ang, similar orders were issued against Uchida, who had already left, and Hirayama, who had never appeared. According to Swettenham, the prisoners were anxious to leave immediately and were allowed to board the Sado Maru, which departed for Hong Kong on its way to Japan the next day. Although he took no official action against Sun, the governor made it clear that he would not permit revolutionary agitation in his territory, and even tried to convince Sun that “it was inexpedient for a patriotic Chinese to raise fresh disturbances in China just at the moment it was about to be invaded by foreigners.” Since K’ang’s attitude had foiled the primary object of his visit, and the British were frowning upon his activities in general, Sun took his other companions and joined the banished Japanese on the Sado Maru.<br>On July 17, just a month after he had first arrived there with such high hopes, Sun was back in Hong Kong waters. Though the path to K’ang Yu-wei had led to a dead end, the possibility of aligning with Li Hung-chang was still alive. Sun was still awaiting the results . of the approach via Liu Hsüeh-hsün, and, as their ship reached Hong Kong, he confided to Miyazaki that his friends in the colony had thought of yet another way to reach Li.<br>Even more than the Canton gentry, the British in Hong Kong were unnerved by the prospect of a power vacuum in the two Kwang provinces, where secret societies of the same breed as the Boxers might be expected to enjoy free rein. It was only a year since the uneasy take-over of the New Territories acquired in 1898, and the Triads had apparently played a part in Chinese resistance. Also, during the last days of T’an Chung-lin’s administration, free-wheeling piracy on the West River and uninhibited banditry in the entire area had not allowed the British the fullest enjoyment of their new acquisition. With Li Hung-chang’s arrival at the beginning of 1900, the situation had improved. Until now, Li, like the other non-belligerent officials, had kept his domain comparatively quiet and peaceful, and the news of his impending departure in response to an imperial summons caused consternation in the colony. In addition to being worried over the security of Western lives and property in the area, including Hong Kong itself, the British suspected Li’s motives. Why was he willing to obey an imperial edict though the extremists were still in control in Peking? The legations, besieged from June 20 to August 14, were at this time still cut off, and it was known that the German minister had been killed. There was no assurance that the other foreigners had not met with a similar fate. (Such was the panic and suspicion that gripped the treaty port communities that credence was placed in a particularly blood-curdling story, later attributed to someone called “The Shanghai Liar,” according to which the legations had been overrun, and every foreign man, woman, and child boiled alive in oil. Memorial services were even held in St. Paul’s and other churches abroad.) Uncertain as to what was happening in the north, indignant, and perhaps a little hysterical over what they had heard, the British in Hong Kong were reluctant to let the Manchu regime dictate a change in the administration of the southern provinces. And considering the possibility that the whole country was about to be partitioned, they were anxious to protect their own interests in the two Kwang provinces. Knowledge of strong Japanese influence among the Chinese dissidents undoubtedly contributed to their fear of being left out. Thus they were receptive to the idea of underwriting an entente between Li Hung-chang and Sun, should the two get together along the lines suggested by Liu Hsüeh-hsün.<br>According to Ch’en Shao-pai, Ho Kai was actively involved with Sun once more and tried to use the good offices of Governor Blake to persuade Li Hung-chang to declare the independence of two Kwangs. This new southern government, headed by Li, would then invite the cooperation of Sun’s forces and the protection of the British. The first step was for the revolutionaries to win Blake over and then have him, or the British representatives in Canton, act as intermediaries to Li. Sun is said to have agreed to the scheme, and to have signed along with other Hsing Chung Hui members a proclamation, drafted in English by Ho, which outlined the reasons for the establishment of the new regime and described its political program. The proclamation was sent to Blake, who gave it his approval and then requested the British Consul in Canton to sound out Li’s feelings. Without commiting himself, Li is said to have reacted favorably.<br>While British sources do not confirm the details of Ch’en Shao-pai’s accounts, they do offer proof of Blake’s intention to act the honest broker between Li and Sun. There is no evidence, however, that he was involved to the extent claimed by the revolutionaries. It appears, for axample, that Liu Hsüeh-hsün’s original approach to Sun preceded Governor Blake’s intervention. since the governor had been on a leave of absence from April through June and did not return to Hong Kong until July 2. By that time, Sun had already received Liu ‘s letter, which we are told came to him as a surprise, and had passed through Hong Kong on his way to Saigon. This of course does not preclude possibilitv of Ho Kai’s having concocted the scheme prior to Blake’s arrival. In that case he might have been in touch with Major General Gascoigne, who was temporarily administering government of Hong Kong. But that official made no mention of the revolutionaries when on June 20 he first reported Li’s having received orders to go north. He did suggest that Li should be restrained from leaving Canton, but the Colonial Office did not think such a course would be feasible. The following day, Gascoigne reported that Li Hung-chang intended to come to Hong Kong on a China Merchants Company steamer with a personal guard of one hundred men and then to transfer to a Canadian Pacific ship bound for Shanghai and Tientsin. While Gascoigne still thought it advisable that Li be detained, he also realized that such a move would risk making an enemy of a man whom he still considered to be friendly to Britain. Yet the fact that Li had requested permission to pass through the colony raised the possibility that he was fishing for an honorable way of disobeying the court. Or he may have wanted some sign of British approval to lend more prestige to his peace-maker role. Thus his protégé in London, Lo Feng-lu, sounded out Britain’s attitude, and on June 22, Salisbury replied that Britain had no objections to Li’s departure.<br>Thus far, Hong Kong had not mentioned the revolutionaries in connection with Li. However Blake, upon returning to the colony, was immediately approached by one of Sun’s representatives, probably Ho Kai, and he then commenced his telegraphic appeals to London on behalf of the conspirators. His first message informed the Colonial Office that anti-Manchu uprising were scheduled to break out in Hunan and in the south within “a fortnight’s time.” “The Chinese gentlemen,” who had taken him into confidence, assured him that the rebels were not anti-foreign and hoped for British protection once they achieved some success. Li Hung-chang. Blake continued. “is coquetting with, this movement and there are rumours that he wishes to establish himself either as king or as president.” After mentioning the Liu-Sun negotiations, Blake concluded that the report of the projected uprisings seemed reliable and that Britain should be prepared to look after her interests on both the Yangtze and the West River.<br>On the 13th, after being warned by Swettenham that Sun and his entourage were on their way back from Singapore. Blake wired London that British interests would best be served if Sun were allowed to conclude a pact with Governor-General Li. According to Blake’s sources, Li offered to arm the “refo1mers” and the British governor considered the proposed entente a guarantee for peace in the south. He feared that “any great disturbance may resolve itself into an anti-foreign movement.” With Blake briefed by his friends, and both Hong Kong and London upset by the Boxer crisis, Sun Yat·sen came closer at this point to receiving official British approval than perhaps at any other time in his life. While Chamberlain and Salisbury concurred with the Hong Kong view, they nevertheless emphasized the qualifying clause in Blake’s proposal; only if Sun returned to the colony with the approval of Li Hung·chang were they prepared to lift the banishment order. But on July 8, Peking had already renewed its pressure on Li and appointed him to his former post as Governor-General of Chihli and Minister of Trade for the Northern Ports. Conciliated by the court and urged by anti-war officials to go north and save the situation; Li was now prepared to abort the negotiations with Sun and go at least part of the way to Peking.<br>Blake received this news from Consul Scott in Canton on July 13 and sent instructions the next day that Li should be urged to reconsider his decision. Salisbury also wired Scott that the cause of peace would best be served if Li remained in Canton. Politely refusing this advice, Li inquired whether he could be granted an interview when he passed through Hong Kong. The governor in the meantime implored London for permission to detain Li by force. Sharing Gascoigne’s opinion, Blake felt that Li would not object. He also cited a telegram from an official of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in Shanghai, who feared that Li’s arrival there would harm the good relations which the British consul was enjoying with the Yangtze officials. While London deliberated, Blake sent another telegram on the 17th announcing that he was expecting Li the following morning and that he and his military advisers believed that Li’s new appointment must have been made by the notorious Prince Tuan and should not be recognized by the British government. He intended to detain Li pending receipt of instructions from Chamberlain, which he hoped to receive before nine in the morning. He did not have to wait long, for on that same day a telegram arrived from Chamberlain forbidding the detention of Li Hung-chang or any forcible interference with his movements. Thus the initiative was taken out of Blake’s hands and passed over to Li.<br>By a coincidence, the Sado Maru, carrying Sun, Miyazaki, et al. arrived on the 17th, the day Li was due from Canton. When their ship pulled into the harbor, Sun and his friends realized that things were not going well. Sun was still barred from the colony, and Miyazaki and Kiyofuji, thanks to the Singapore episode, were also on the banished list. Sun’s local associates told him that in the scheduled meeting the following morning, Blake would make a last stand to keep Li in Canton. If Li agreed to remain, or if he were detained after the conference, Sun would be allowed to land and negotiate with him. Although Sun told Miyazaki that he did not have too much confidence in the aged statesman’s ability to take a broad view of the political situation (Li was 77 years old at this time), he thought it worth a try. His friend agreed that this was a unique opportunity to establish a base in the Kwangtung-Kwangsi provinces. Neither of course knew that Blake had already been immobilized by Chamberlain.<br>On the 17th, Ho Kai’s friend and fellow-member of the Legislative Council, Wei Yuk, called upon Blake, and speaking for the Chinese residents of Hong Kong who had families in Canton, begged the governor to use his influence to keep Li from leaving.<br>He told Blake that a “well-known Chinese official, closely connected with the Yamen,” had come to Hong Kong and informed him that, while Li did not dare to disregard the imperial edict, he would welcome an excuse for refusing.<br>This official may have been Liu Hsüeh-hsün, and if so, he was apparently acting on his own, or on behalf of the Canton gentry, for when Li Hung-chang met Blake on the following day, he showed no sign of wanting to be restrained. And far from suggesting a rendezvous with Sun Yat-sen, he urged the governor to prevent subversive elements from using Hong Kong as a base. On the other hand, in his conversation with Blake, which he specifically requested be reported to Salisbury, Li hinted at his own availability should the foreign powers decide to replace the Manchus with a Chinese ruler.<br>Blake expressed regret at Li’s decision to leave. Li replied that he could not disobey an imperial edict and insisted that this order had been signed by the Empress Dowager and the emperor, and not, as Blake suggested, by Prince Tuan. The governor kept pressing him to change his mind and ensure the preservation of peace in the south, pointing out that if even so strong an official as Chang Chih-tung could not keep order in Hupeh, “how could the Cantonese province be controlled without its viceroy?” Li replied that the Cantonese were more “sensible” than the people of Hunan and Hupeh, and then, as Blake phrased it, proceeded to “turn the tables upon” him by declaring that the principal danger to peace in Kwangtung lay in Hong Kong. He claimed the colony was filled with Triads and other “dangerous characters,” who had been driven there and to Singapore by his own effective measures of repression. Some thirty thousand men, he asserted, were assembled in the two colonies in preparation for an attack upon Kwangtung in the near future. The governor then assured him that he would keep the peace in Hong Kong and that known members of the Triad society were being dealt with sternly.<br>But Li was not so interested in talking about Kwangtung as he was in determining Britain’s preference regarding the future rule of his country. Specifically he asked, “whom would England like to see Emperor?” Blake replied that as far as he knew, and providing the legations were safe, Britain’s main concern was the restoration of order and the resumption of trade and business. She did not want to see China partitioned, nor did she entertain any territorial ambitions of her own. If she were satisfied that the Kuang-hsü Emperor had not been responsible for the actions taken in his name, he assumed there would be no objection to his continued reign “under certain conditions,” but this was only his own private opinion.<br>Li obviously had been giving the matter a great deal of thought and propounded the following question. If it is true, he said, that only the German minister had been killed by the Boxers, then the foreign powers would not have the right to decide who would be emperor. But if all the ministers were killed (and at this time no news had been received from Peking since July 8), the powers, he felt, could legitimately interfere and declare, “We will set up an Emperor.” If that happened, he asked, “whom would the Powers elect?” He assumed, he went on, that their choice would be “a person of Chinese na tionality.” All that Blake could say in reply was that the foreign powers “would probably ask the advice of the strongest man in China that they could find as to what was best to be done.” After being satisfied that his bid had been entered, Li asserted that despite all her mistakes, the Empress Dowager was “undoubtedly the most capable ruler in China.” In London, however, the Colonial Office made note of Li’s “not being averse to becoming Emperor himself.”<br>Li also took the opportunity to plead for magnanimity when the allied powers should occupy Peking, and warned that a vengeful spirit would cause universal hatred of foreigners. From his attitude, it was clear that he was preparing for his future role in the north, as China’s ambassador of peace or possibly her new ruler. If a chastened Peking gave him a free hand and the foreigners had no objections, there was no need to involve himself in a separatist adventure in the south, such as had been broached by Liu Hsüeh-hsün. But until he was certain these conditions were satisfied, Li did not rush straight on to Peking, and Blake’s report of the rumor that Li planned to stay in Shanghai “until the tide turns” proved to be well-founded. The canny statesman spent three months in Shanghai before finally deciding that the court had had enough of the Boxers and that he would be free to sue for peace. Once he left Hong Kong, however, the revolutionaries’ plan to enlist his cooperation fell through, and when he visited Li’s ship, Ch’en Shao-pai was told the bad news by Liu Hsüeh-hsün and Tseng Kuang-ch’üan, another of the governor-general’s intimates. The Hong Kong government, of course, now had no reason for relaxing the banishment order, and Sun Yat-sen stayed on board the Sado Maru, which departed for Japan on July 20.<br>Although the two-pronged approach to Li Hung-chang, through Liu and the Hong Kong Governor, had failed, Sun did not yet despair of obtaining the direct assistance of these intermediaries, who were powers in their own right. Liu had money and Blake’s position spoke for itself. Both could be of tremendous importance now that plans for the negotiated seizure of the southern provinces had given way to Sun’s alternative scheme of a military assault on the eastern Kwangtung coast. While proceeding from Japan in June, the plotters had already mapped out a preliminary division of labor in which the Japanese were conspicuously prominent, and after the failures of July their sessions were increasingly devoted to practical war strategy. At this stage, Blake became the object of Sun’s attentions. Before the Sado Maru departed, there were a few days left for charting an approach to the governor in the hope of ensuring a friendly base at Hong Kong, and perhaps even more positive British support when the attack succeeded. Ho Kai presumably served as spokesman again, and on the 21st, according to Tse Tsan-tai, Ho reported that the governor was “in favor of a Southern Republic for China.”<br>While Blake seemed to be a sympathetic recipient of the conspirators’ confidences, it is questionable whether his support was as unqualified as Tse related. Only four months earlier he had declared that a republic was impossible in China. According to his dispatches to London during this period, his chief concern was the danger of violence in the south. Any kind of violence, even that directed against the Manchu regime, which he and the treaty port spokesman held responsible for triggering the anti-foreign explosion in the north, was considered to be a threat to Western lives and property. Securing peace in the south had been the object of his unsuccessful dealings with Li Hung-chang, and now that Li had left, he still had to consider the prospect of uprisings by both Sun’s and K’ang’s forces. Blake’s memorandum to the Colonial Office on August 3 reveals that Sun’s agents approached him after Li’s departure and that Blake replied by offering them an alternative to armed uprising.<br>First of all, Blake related that “some Chinese gentlemen who are deeply interested in the reform movement” (Ho Kai and<br>Wei Yuk?) had told him of an imminent rebellion in the Canton area. Blake, giving the British position stated above, had warned the “reformist” spokesmen that, whatever sympathies he might feel for their aspirations, the attacks on foreigners which would probably result from such an uprising might provoke Western intervention and destruction of the insurgents, even without the participation of Chinese imperial forces. As an alternative, he suggested that they draw up:<br>a numerously signed petition to the Powers showing clearly the reforms that they demand, and stating that they took this course impelled by the desire to avoid any action that would embarrass the Powers in the present crisis, in the hope that, when ultimate arrangements are being made, their demands will be insisted upon and conceded without the loss of life and property and the general derangement that must follow an armed rebellion.<br>Blake informed London that his suggestion had been conveyed to both Sun’s “reformers” and K’ang Yu-wei’s group. The latter, he disclosed, included the American adventurer, Homer Lea, who had been sent to China by K’ang’s followers in San Francisco. According to Blake’s information, Lea was promoting a fantastic scheme to attack Canton from Macao with a coolie army of 25,000 under American officers. The Portuguese authorities in Macao were to be bribed, and the Governor of Macao was to be placated with a promise of territorial compensation. Lea endorsed a merger with Sun’s forces but was overruled by K’ang’s supporters in Macao, who also turned down Blake’s proposition. Probably because they were already committed to action on the Yangtze and were also afraid that further delay would jeopardize the emperor’s life, they were not willing to forego a responsive uprising in Kwangtung.<br>Though K’ang had recently sent Blake a pro-European declaration and a request that the invading foreigners reinstate the emperor, the governor was more impressed by Sun’s spokesmen. Not only were they more consistently pro-Western, but on this occasion they agreed to “adopt the memorial to the Powers.” This was Blake’s understanding of their response. But the question arises as to whether they ever sent a petition to the foreign governments such as he had proposed.<br>It will be recalled that, according to Ch’en Shao-pai, who is followed by other revolutionary historians, a political program had been drawn up in English by Ho Kai, and after being signed by the Hsing Chung Hui leaders, was submitted for the consideration of Blake and Li Hung-chang. Blake could not have entered the picture until the beginning of July. Nor did he mention such a statement when he was explaining the logic of a Li-Sun agreement to London. And finally, if he had already received Ho’s document, there would have been no need to make a further request at his meeting with the “reformist” sympathizers, which probably took place in the latter part of July or the beginning of August 1900. This leads us to the tentative conclusion that Ho’s statement, called the “Regulations for Peaceful Rule” (P’ing-chih chang-ch’eng) was not a product of the Li-Sun negotiations, but resulted from Sun’s later overture to Blake, via Ho Kai, and was in response to the governor’s above-mentioned proposition. In other words, Sun’s group may have contemplated deferring the Waichow uprising it was then planning in the hope of riding to power on the coat-tails of the invading armies in the north.<br>This of course does not preclude the likelihood that similar proposals were advanced earlier for the benefit of Li. In that case, they would have been framed expressly for an independent Kwangtung-Kwangsi; but as Marius Jansen has noted, the fact that Ho’s document outlined a future national government separates it from the proposition made to Li. That Ho’s plan was inspired by Blake’s suggestion, however, cannot be fully verified because the governor never forwarded it to London or acknowledged its receipt. Only the revolutionary sources claim that it was sent, and the only version available is the Chinese translation. <br>There is no question that Ho was the author. The program contained proposals which he had consistently advanced and seemed expressly designed to win the approval of Europeans, who considered foreign tutelage the most effective means of reforming China. Boxers and Manchus were condemned for anti-foreignism while leading officials were charged with vacillation. The signatories were prepared to act but required foreign assistance in order to reconstruct China for the mutual benefit of Chinese and foreigners. They therefore submitted a six-point program which they hoped Britain and her “comrade” nations would help to implement.<br>The plan did not explicitly declare for republicanism but merely defined the future head of government as one who would be responsive to the people’s wishes and subject to constitutional restraints. Foreign diplomats would constitute a temporary advisory body to the central government while the various consuls-general performed a similar function in the provinces. The remaining proposals included: an emphasis upon federalism and local at1tonomy, the gradual introduction of suffrage, modernization of the bureaucratic, legal, and examination systems, the promise of an unrestricted and non-discriminatory opening of China to foreign commercial and industrial interests, continued surrender of Chinese Maritime Customs’ autonomy, and protection of missionaries and churches. All were carried over from Ho’s previous works. There was also an attempt to appease the traditional elite by suggesting that degree-holders, kung-shih, be sent to the provincial and national legislatures.<br>An even more blatantly pro-European program, in which, for example, the proposed foreign advisers were simply called “dictators,” was advanced by the China Mail at the beginning of August 1900. Although the paper suggested that the Kuang-hsü Emperor be retained if alive, it outlined a reconstituted Chinese government, which was generally compatible with Ho’s program, and at the end of the month, Ho in fact endorsed the Mail’s plan as the recommended course for the allied powers.<br>Tse Tsan-tai even referred to the paper’s editorial as “Dr. Ho Kai’s article based on the terms of our political program.” This editorial, it might be mentioned, warned that ‘from all corners of the earth the avengers are speeding, and Peking will be reached though the road should be paved with dead. Peking will be swept off the face of the land … ·.”<br>On August 18, Blake again asked London for permission to negotiate. He telegraphed Chamberlain that the K’ang and Sun factions were “enlisting foreigners of a doubtful character, and preparing for active operations in Canton and neighborhood.” Since this would hurt British interests, he asked if it would “be prudent to have an assurance conveyed to K’ang and Sun that, if they abstain from action, Her Majesty’s Government will, in the settlement of the present difficulties, consider and press for any fair and reasonable reforms that the people may demand.” Two days later Chamberlain replied that the British government could not “sanction any such promises,” and Blake was further instructed to clamp down on Chinese agitators like K’ang and Sun. Blake’s second effort on behalf of Sun was therefore no more successful than his first in connection with Li Hung-chang.<br>Though it would seem logical to assume that Governor Blake would have at this time presented Chamberlain with a list of the “fair and reasonable reforms” drawn up by Ho, his failure to do so may have meant that the conspirators were hesitating to make the commitment he demanded. Or alternatively, he may have sought some sign of approval from Chamberlain before disclosing the details of his negotiations with Sun’s representatives. But there was yet another unexplained development.<br>On September 24, a month after his exchange with Chamberlain, Blake sent the Colonial Secretary a copy of a document which he had received in Chinese from anonymous reformers. This turned out to be still another request that the allied powers forcibly carry out the reformation of China. They asked that the Kuang-hsü Emperor be restored, but if he did not agree to set up a new government, one of the governors-general should be chosen to “manage the affairs of the country.” Foreign advisers were to be deputized to assist in carrying out reforms, including modernization of the penal code, but were to be withdrawn after affairs were settled. The new government was to be a constitutional monarchy like that of Britain and Japan, and the distinction between Manchu and Chinese was to be erased. The signatories had chosen anonymity because of the fear of reprisals, not only upon their relatives and friends, but upon the graves of their ancestors. They were convinced, however, that there was widespread support for their position, and requested that the treaty port consuls guarantee the safety of “officials, gentry, literati, and business men” so that they might sign an appeal of this nature.<br>The signatories apparently did not belong to K’ang Yu-wei’s party because they criticized the reformers of 1898 as being more interested in wreaking vengeance on the conservatives than in carrying out reforms. To what group, then, can this petition be attributed? Could this have been an attempt by Sun’s party to comply with Blake’s suggestion of the previous month that they present the powers with a “numerously signed petition” demanding intervention? The contents of the document are not incompatible with such a possibility.<br>At any rate, Blake, having previously been repudiated by London, was noncommittal in transmitting it. His only comment was that he had heard from “an apparently reliable source” that the reform party was preparing to rise should the question of reform be untouched in the pending Boxer settlement. But when this intelligence reached London on October 26, Sun’s uprising had already taken place and failed. In retrospect, the Hong Kong-based intrigues appear to have been a watershed in Sun’s career. This was the last occasion when Ho Kai would act as his spokesman. Sun had outgrown him. Ho, for all his patriotism and interest in constitutional government, still bore the burden of a dual allegiance. Though many of his specific proposals soon found their way into Sun’s political vocabulary, his active participation was limited to presenting the revolutionary case to foreigners whenever the occasion arose. He was essentially a conditional revolutionary, who could not conceive of activism except when supported by British gunboats.<br>Sun, on the other hand, was obsessed with the idea of revolution and the restoration of Chinese greatness. His total absorption in revolution had pushed him beyond the confines of Hong Kong and the treaty ports. His exposure to European political movements, to the influence of Miyazaki’s radical pan-Asianism, to Liang Ch’i-ch’ao and other literati refugees — all pointed the way to a tougher nationalism which aimed at the unequivocal assertion of Chinese independence and equality. But most important of all was Sun’s unswerving faith in himself as the agent of China’s regeneration. The overtures to Li Hung-chang and the British had not exhausted his capacity for intrigue. And nothing could dampen his commitment to action.<br>After the negotiations of july and August 1900 fell through, Ho Kai resumed his role as Justice of the Peace in Hong Kong while Sun Yat-sen held a council-of-war. This was the real difference between them.</p></div></div></section>
