Drastic is too mild a term to apply to the steps taken by Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s military hirelings to suppress the merchants’ movement to obtain delivery of the arms, imported on the s.s. “Hav” for which, they have paid and for which an import permit was issued by one of Dr. Sun’s accredited officials.</p><p name="5843" id="5843" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On Tuesday, a proclamation was issued by the Civil Governor, Mr. Hu Han-min, and countersigned by General Yang Hsi-min, commander-in-chief under martial law, and three other Generals (Hsu Chung-chi, Tan Yen-kai and Fan Shek-sang) — — a proclamation by which the Merchants Volunteers Corps was ordered to’be dissolved.” To the casual reader, the proclamation conveys little more than the usual official manner in which such organisations are dissolved. With the proclamation per se we have no quarrel. If the Canton Government does not wish to countenance the Merchants Volunteer Corps, it is at perfect liberty to dissolve it. The means to attain this end, however, recall the worst acts of the Lenine regime in Russia.</p><p name="3d1c" id="3d1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is well-known that the Volunteers were very poorly armed compared to the 40,000 soldiers at Sun’s command. It would, therefore, have been an easy matter to surround the Volunteers and gain an almost bloodless victory.</p><p name="70b4" id="70b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dr. Sun Yat-sen, however, has read the writing on the wall and is well aware that it is not only the Merchants’ Volunteers who have tired of his rule. The “Canton Gazette” states that “the Merchants Volunteer Corps had been engaged in secretly distributing circulars calling upon the shops and business houses to start a general strike from Friday last, in order to bring the Government to its knees and give over control of the city to the self-constituted champions of the people, to wit, the Merchants’ Volunteer Corps headed by Chan Lim-pak, compradore of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, and his hirelings.”<br><br>The official organ, while presumably paving the way for whitewashing those responsible for Wednesday’s massacre, admits the real cause of Dr .Sun’s fears. The strike of the merchants was more to be feared than the alleged insidious activities of the Volunteers. “We must teach the Canton rabble a lesson, said the ‘compleat Bolshevik’ Sun Yat-sen. We will pre-suppose violent opposition and strike first” — orders to this effect were probably given. At any rate, all reports to hand go to show that Dr. Sun’s hirelings opened the attack and having driven off the Volunteers proceeded to loot the town.</p><p name="7958" id="7958" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During and after the fighting, it appears that fires were started by the troops of the President. It is not likely that the world will ever learn the number of innocent victims of Wednesday’s slaughter — — a mild enough word in all conscience to describe the cold-blooded murder of shop-keepers and their families for going on strike — — a method of protest which, Dr. Sun and his precious son, Mayor Sun-fo, tacitly commended in the recent Shameen affair. Had any genuine attempt been made to open the shops and disarm the Volunteers by a show of force, one might be able to find some excuse for retaliation, if the soldiers had met with opposition. All accounts, however, tend to the belief that the Canton affair was butchery as cold-blooded as it was calculated.</p><p name="0a37" id="0a37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">摘自The China Mail, 1924–10–17</p></div></div></section>
