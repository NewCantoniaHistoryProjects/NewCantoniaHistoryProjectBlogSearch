Top Nationalist officers and officials were reported to have boarded a ship at Yulin yesterday. One report said the generals headed for Indo-China and retirement rather than Formosa. As long ago as last November it had been reported that these generals had representatives in Saigon, Indo-China, dickering for their admission to Indo-China when the time came.</p><p name="bcbc" id="bcbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With their leaders gone there seemed little left for the estimated 100,000 Nationalist troops but to defect or surrender to about 40,000 Communist soldiers believed to be on the island.</p><p name="d40a" id="d40a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The effect of the events of the past few days on the future of the Kuomintang is bound to be profound. For several months its forces have been free from serious pressure from the Communist armies. They had built up an impression of growing morale and even spoke of invading the mainland.</p><p name="97a8" id="97a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During the past week the Chinese Communists succeeded in the face of what should have been overwhelming odds, both in numbers and material.</p><p name="927e" id="927e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Generalissimo Chiang’s final bastion of Formosa is far better defended, and he is determined to hold it, whereas apparently he did not expect to hold Hainan. However, the Communists still are hugging closely their trump card, the new “People’s Air Force,” which is soon expected to make its debut over Formosa.</p><p name="a84a" id="a84a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Arrivals from Hainan late yesterday said they had seen no signs of Nationalist troops or planes. The air force apparently had evacuated to Formosa.</p><p name="15be" id="15be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the keys to the Communists’ success was their rapid expansion of the guerrilla army in the center of the island during the weeks preceding the invasion on April 17. Another important factor was undoubtedly the secret stockpiling of food on the island to feed the newly landed troops. The pre-invasion mobilization that boosted the guerrilla army to an estimated 30,000 men was described by a Communist official of the New China News Agency, as follows:</p><p name="8d10" id="8d10" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Big stocks of food for the army were brought together and in the island’s liberation areas able-bodied men of various nationalities flocked to join the colors. Enlistment in Loktung County was three times the number of volunteers called for. In another small locality the figure was 1,000 men above the plan.</p><p name="c105" id="c105" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Every village and hamlet in the liberated areas sent its tally of men while those remaining behind stored up food. Women were to be seen lecturing on platforms urging their men to take up arms — a very remarkable phenomenon, for Li women are noted for their shyness.”</p><p name="6bfa" id="6bfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Secretly Stockpiled</p><p name="6fa6" id="6fa6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Li people are an important national group on Hainan. The broadcast said the food had been secretly stockpiled in Kuomintang areas, too.</p><p name="64b8" id="64b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Communist news agency also distributed yesterday several congratulatory messages from regional army commands. One was from Gen. Lin Piao and staff, datelined Hankow. Unofficial press reports here, on the other hand, asserted he was on Luichow Peninsula opposite Hainan. A message from leaders in the southwest military area said they would continue to support troops in the Hainan and Formosan operations “and also vow to accelerate the liberation of Tibet.”</p><p name="0513" id="0513" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">New York Times, MONDAY, APRIL 24, 1950</p></div></div></section>
